## Abstract

This document specifies SHRINCS (_Shrunken SPHINCS_), a hash-based post-quantum signature scheme, for use in Bitcoin transaction authorization.

SHRINCS combines compact stateful hash-based signatures with a stateless fallback[^hbsb].
It is instantiated with SHA256, targeting NIST security category 1: 128 bits of classical and 64 bits of quantum security.
A security proof is TODO.

This specification describes the key generation, signing, and verification algorithms of SHRINCS.

## Motivation

SHRINCS offers compact post-quantum signatures under conservative cryptographic assumptions.
It relies solely on the security of its underlying hash function.
In this specification, that function is SHA256, which is already fundamental to Bitcoin's security.
Signature schemes from other post-quantum families also rely on hash-function security but additionally require separate hardness assumptions, such as the hardness of lattice problems.
Bitcoin outputs may remain unspent for long periods, making conservative cryptographic assumptions particularly valuable.
This conservatism gives hash-based signature schemes like SHRINCS a distinct place in the cryptographic design space, even when schemes from other families offer better size or performance.

Signature size is particularly important in Bitcoin because signatures consume scarce block space.
SHRINCS therefore offers signers a compact stateful signing path at the cost of additional implementation complexity.
This path allows SHRINCS to leverage the fact that a key pair in Bitcoin is typically used only a few times.
As a result, stateful SHRINCS signatures can be many times smaller than those of standardized hash-based signature schemes.
The minimum combined size of a SHRINCS public key and stateful signature is roughly <!-- CONST START SLH_DSA_128S_SIZE_RATIO -->13.23<!-- CONST END SLH_DSA_128S_SIZE_RATIO -->x smaller than that of SLH-DSA-SHA2-128s[^slhdsa] and <!-- CONST START ML_DSA_SIZE_RATIO -->6.26<!-- CONST END ML_DSA_SIZE_RATIO -->x smaller than that of the lattice-based ML-DSA-44 scheme (which targets NIST security category 2, whereas SHRINCS targets category 1).


## Overview

At a high level, a SHRINCS instance combines two hash-based signature schemes:

1. A **stateful** component — a flexible XMSS (FXMSS) tree of WOTS+C[^sphincs+c] one-time signatures.
2. A **stateless** component — SLH-DSA[^slhdsa], the NIST-standardized variant of SPHINCS+[^sphincs+], with a non-standard parameter set.

A signature from either component is sufficient to pass verification.
The signer uses the stateful component as its compact, primary path, and falls back to the stateless component when signing state is unavailable (lost, corrupted, or intentionally reset, e.g. after seed recovery).

The **stateful** component, FXMSS, generates small signatures.
It is a variant of XMSS[^xmss].
In XMSS, the public key is the root of a Merkle tree whose leaves are one-time-signature public keys, and each signature is a single one-time signature together with the Merkle authentication path from its leaf to the root.
The signer must maintain state so that no leaf is used to sign more than once.

FXMSS is _flexible_ in that the signer chooses the shape of the tree.
An _unbalanced_ tree minimizes the size of the first few signatures but makes each subsequent signature larger, suiting signers that produce few signatures.
A _balanced_ tree instead produces constant-size signatures.

The **stateless** component generates larger signatures, but does not require the signer to manage state.
An SLH-DSA parameter set determines its _signature budget_: the maximum number of signatures that may be produced under one public key while retaining the targeted security level.
Standardized SLH-DSA supports a budget of 2<sup>64</sup> signatures; the non-standard parameter set used here reduces this to 2<sup>40</sup>, which in turn yields signatures smaller than SLH-DSA-SHA2-128s.

Each component produces a 16-byte root hash as part of its public key.
These two roots, together with a 16-byte seed value, form the 48-byte SHRINCS public key:

```py
PK = pk_seed || sl_root || sf_root
```

The SHRINCS verification algorithm consists mostly of evaluating a series of hash functions on elements of the signature to recompute a certain hash.
Ultimately the verifier recomputes one of the SHRINCS public key components: a stateful signature is checked against `sf_root`, a stateless signature against `sl_root`.

Public key and signature sizes are summarized below:

| Item | Size (min - max) |
|:--|:--|
| Public key | 48 bytes |
| Stateful signature | <!-- CONST START SHRINCS_SF_SIGNATURE_SIZE_MIN -->548<!-- CONST END SHRINCS_SF_SIGNATURE_SIZE_MIN --> - <!-- CONST START SHRINCS_SF_SIGNATURE_SIZE_MAX -->4619<!-- CONST END SHRINCS_SF_SIGNATURE_SIZE_MAX --> bytes |
| Stateless signature | <!-- CONST START SHRINCS_SL_SIGNATURE_SIZE -->5777<!-- CONST END SHRINCS_SL_SIGNATURE_SIZE --> bytes |

### Relation to SLH-DSA

The stateless component of SHRINCS uses the SLH-DSA algorithms defined in NIST FIPS-205 with a parameter set that is not among those standardized in FIPS-205 (see [Parameters](#parameters)).
The hash functions are instantiated with SHA256, as in the FIPS-205 parameter sets of the SHA2 family at security category 1.

The algorithms specified below, `slh_dsa_sign` and `slh_dsa_verify`, match the FIPS-205 algorithms `slh_sign` (Algorithm 22) and `slh_verify` (Algorithm 24), except that in this document `slh_dsa_sign` receives optional additional randomness from its caller rather than generating it internally as in FIPS-205 Algorithm 22.
An SLH-DSA implementation that supports custom parameter sets can therefore be used for the stateless component of SHRINCS, with a thin wrapper to produce SHRINCS signatures.

This document nonetheless respecifies these algorithms in full, rather than referring to FIPS-205, in order to present both components of SHRINCS in one consistent notation.
The exact correspondence between parameters common between this document and FIPS-205 is given in [the section on stateless parameters](#stateless-parameters).

## Performance

SHRINCS performance during key generation, signing, and verification is dominated by hash function calls.
The tables below therefore report SHA256 compression counts computed by [`impl/meta.py`](./impl/meta.py).
The signing and verification counts assume a 32-byte caller-supplied message and an empty context.
Actual runtimes depend on the implementation, including its use of SHA256 hardware acceleration.[^sha_ni_bench]

### Verification

In this table we show exact compression counts, and show the maximum _compressions per byte_ (C/B) needed to verify a SHRINCS stateful and stateless signature.

| Signing Component | Verify Cost in SHA256 Compressions (min - max) | C/B (max) |
|-|-|-|
| Stateful SHRINCS | <!-- CONST START STATEFUL_VERIFY_COMPRESSIONS_MIN -->255<!-- CONST END STATEFUL_VERIFY_COMPRESSIONS_MIN --> - <!-- CONST START STATEFUL_VERIFY_COMPRESSIONS_MAX -->509<!-- CONST END STATEFUL_VERIFY_COMPRESSIONS_MAX --> | <!-- CONST START STATEFUL_VERIFY_COMPRESSIONS_PER_BYTE_MAX -->0.465<!-- CONST END STATEFUL_VERIFY_COMPRESSIONS_PER_BYTE_MAX --> |
| Stateless SHRINCS | <!-- CONST START STATELESS_VERIFY_COMPRESSIONS_MIN -->467<!-- CONST END STATELESS_VERIFY_COMPRESSIONS_MIN --> - <!-- CONST START STATELESS_VERIFY_COMPRESSIONS_MAX -->2792<!-- CONST END STATELESS_VERIFY_COMPRESSIONS_MAX --> | <!-- CONST START STATELESS_VERIFY_COMPRESSIONS_PER_BYTE_MAX -->0.483<!-- CONST END STATELESS_VERIFY_COMPRESSIONS_PER_BYTE_MAX --> |

The variance in stateful verify compression count can be caused by signers supplying larger stateful signatures, which require additional hash invocations to verify.
The variance in stateless compression count can be controlled by the signer with no change to signature size, and is owed to the fact that the signatures of the WOTS-TW subscheme have a non-constant verification cost which depends on a signer-controlled hash.

SHRINCS verification time can be reduced using CPU instructions designed specifically for SHA256[^sha_ni_bench] or by evaluating independent SHA256 computations in parallel with vectorized (SIMD) CPU instructions[^simd_bench].

For comparison, the cost of BIP-340 Schnorr verification can be expressed as an equivalent number of SHA256 compression calls by benchmarking both operations on the same system.
One benchmark using libsecp256k1's SHA256 implementation found that BIP-340 verification, including public-key parsing, took the same time as 127 compression calls, or 1.98 equivalent compressions per byte of the 64-byte signature.[^bip340_sha256_bench]


### Key Generation

SHRINCS key generation is much slower than verification because it generates the stateless component's top-layer XMSS tree and the stateful component's FXMSS tree.
The cost of key-generation depends on the _structure_ of the stateful component's FXMSS tree - See the [FXMSS](#fxmss) specification section for a full explanation.
In general, putting more up-front work into key-generation allows the key a larger stateful signature budget.
The key-generation cost of the stateless component is constant.

Here we have illustrated several examples of SHRINCS key generation costs for different stateful structures.
Note this cost includes both stateful and stateless components.

| Stateful Structure | Total Key Generation Cost in SHA256 Compressions | Stateful Signature Budget |
|-|-|-|
| UXMSS; depth 31 | <!-- CONST START UXMSS_31_KEYGEN_COMPRESSIONS -->309054<!-- CONST END UXMSS_31_KEYGEN_COMPRESSIONS --> | 32 |
| UXMSS; depth 255 | <!-- CONST START UXMSS_255_KEYGEN_COMPRESSIONS -->425982<!-- CONST END UXMSS_255_KEYGEN_COMPRESSIONS --> | 256 |
| BXMSS; depth 5 | <!-- CONST START BXMSS_5_KEYGEN_COMPRESSIONS -->309054<!-- CONST END BXMSS_5_KEYGEN_COMPRESSIONS --> | 2<sup>5</sup> |
| BXMSS; depth 8 | <!-- CONST START BXMSS_8_KEYGEN_COMPRESSIONS -->425982<!-- CONST END BXMSS_8_KEYGEN_COMPRESSIONS --> | 2<sup>8</sup> |
| BXMSS; depth 10 | <!-- CONST START BXMSS_10_KEYGEN_COMPRESSIONS -->826878<!-- CONST END BXMSS_10_KEYGEN_COMPRESSIONS --> | 2<sup>10</sup> |
| BXMSS; depth 12 | <!-- CONST START BXMSS_12_KEYGEN_COMPRESSIONS -->2430462<!-- CONST END BXMSS_12_KEYGEN_COMPRESSIONS --> | 2<sup>12</sup> |
| BXMSS; depth 16 | <!-- CONST START BXMSS_16_KEYGEN_COMPRESSIONS -->34502142<!-- CONST END BXMSS_16_KEYGEN_COMPRESSIONS --> | 2<sup>16</sup> |
| BXMSS; depth 20 | <!-- CONST START BXMSS_20_KEYGEN_COMPRESSIONS -->547649022<!-- CONST END BXMSS_20_KEYGEN_COMPRESSIONS --> | 2<sup>20</sup> |

SHRINCS key-generation performance can be improved by evaluating independent SHA256 hashes in parallel using vectorized CPU instructions[^simd_bench][^sha256x8], or using CUDA or Vulkan[^vulkan].

One can also improve SHRINCS key-generation performance at the cost of stateless signature budget, using hypertree pruning[^pruning].

### Signing

SHRINCS signing performance depends on whether the signer uses the stateful or stateless component.

- In the stateless component, signing performance varies slightly from message to message.
- In the stateful component, signing performance differs vastly depending on the structure used for the stateful FXMSS tree.

| Signature Type | Average Signing Cost in SHA256 Compressions | Stateful Signature Budget |
|-|-|-|
| Stateless | <!-- CONST START STATELESS_SIGN_COMPRESSIONS_AVG -->1707229<!-- CONST END STATELESS_SIGN_COMPRESSIONS_AVG --> | |
| Stateful (UXMSS; depth 31) | <!-- CONST START UXMSS_31_SIGN_COMPRESSIONS_AVG -->16510<!-- CONST END UXMSS_31_SIGN_COMPRESSIONS_AVG --> | 32 |
| Stateful (UXMSS; depth 255) | <!-- CONST START UXMSS_255_SIGN_COMPRESSIONS_AVG -->133326<!-- CONST END UXMSS_255_SIGN_COMPRESSIONS_AVG --> | 256 |
| Stateful (BXMSS; depth 5) | <!-- CONST START BXMSS_5_SIGN_COMPRESSIONS_AVG -->16522<!-- CONST END BXMSS_5_SIGN_COMPRESSIONS_AVG --> | 2<sup>5</sup> |
| Stateful (BXMSS; depth 8) | <!-- CONST START BXMSS_8_SIGN_COMPRESSIONS_AVG -->133447<!-- CONST END BXMSS_8_SIGN_COMPRESSIONS_AVG --> | 2<sup>8</sup> |
| Stateful (BXMSS; depth 10) | <!-- CONST START BXMSS_10_SIGN_COMPRESSIONS_AVG -->534341<!-- CONST END BXMSS_10_SIGN_COMPRESSIONS_AVG --> | 2<sup>10</sup> |
| Stateful (BXMSS; depth 12) | <!-- CONST START BXMSS_12_SIGN_COMPRESSIONS_AVG -->2137923<!-- CONST END BXMSS_12_SIGN_COMPRESSIONS_AVG --> | 2<sup>12</sup> |
| Stateful (BXMSS; depth 16) | <!-- CONST START BXMSS_16_SIGN_COMPRESSIONS_AVG -->34209599<!-- CONST END BXMSS_16_SIGN_COMPRESSIONS_AVG --> | 2<sup>16</sup> |
| Stateful (BXMSS; depth 20) | <!-- CONST START BXMSS_20_SIGN_COMPRESSIONS_AVG -->547356475<!-- CONST END BXMSS_20_SIGN_COMPRESSIONS_AVG --> | 2<sup>20</sup> |

SHRINCS signing performance can be improved by evaluating independent SHA256 hashes in parallel using vectorized CPU instructions[^simd_bench][^sha256x8], or using CUDA or Vulkan[^vulkan].

To improve stateful signing performance further at the cost of memory, one can cache leaves or internal nodes in the [FXMSS](#fxmss) tree which are produced during key-generation or prior signing attempts.
Caching reduces the fraction of the FXMSS tree which the signer must regenerate on each signing attempt, which is by far the greatest computational cost in stateful signing.
Caching can therefore result in very significant (orders of magnitude) speedups, depending on the stateful tree structure.

The stateless component also admits a small speedup if an implementation can [cache the top-level XMSS tree](https://conduition.io/code/fast-slh-dsa/#XMSS-Tree-Caching).
One can also improve stateless SHRINCS signing performance at the cost of stateless signature budget, using hypertree pruning[^pruning].


## Rationale

### Why not use a standardized SLH-DSA parameter set?

The stateless component of SHRINCS uses a non-standard SLH-DSA parameter set, primarily to reduce the signature budget from 2<sup>64</sup> to 2<sup>40</sup> signatures per public key.
Reducing the signature budget reduces the stateless signature size from 7,856 bytes for SLH-DSA-SHA2-128s to <!-- CONST START SHRINCS_SL_SIGNATURE_SIZE -->5777<!-- CONST END SHRINCS_SL_SIGNATURE_SIZE --> bytes for the stateless component of SHRINCS, a reduction of <!-- CONST START SHRINCS_SL_SIGNATURE_SIZE_REDUCTION_PERCENT -->26<!-- CONST END SHRINCS_SL_SIGNATURE_SIZE_REDUCTION_PERCENT -->%.
The stateless parameter set also requires <!-- CONST START SHRINCS_SL_SIGN_COMPRESSIONS_REDUCTION_PERCENT -->23<!-- CONST END SHRINCS_SL_SIGN_COMPRESSIONS_REDUCTION_PERCENT -->% fewer SHA256 compressions for average-case signing and <!-- CONST START SHRINCS_SL_VERIFY_COMPRESSIONS_REDUCTION_PERCENT -->28<!-- CONST END SHRINCS_SL_VERIFY_COMPRESSIONS_REDUCTION_PERCENT -->% fewer for worst-case verification than SLH-DSA-SHA2-128s.

The 2<sup>40</sup> signature budget remains far beyond what could be exercised on-chain.
With Bitcoin's current 4 MB block size limit, 200 years of blocks would consume approximately <!-- CONST START SHRINCS_SL_SIGNATURE_BUDGET_USED_200_YEARS_PERCENT -->0.66<!-- CONST END SHRINCS_SL_SIGNATURE_BUDGET_USED_200_YEARS_PERCENT -->% of a key's signature budget if all block space were used for stateless SHRINCS signatures under that public key.

The 2<sup>40</sup> signature budget is not reduced further for two reasons.

First, off-chain protocols may generate many signatures under one public key.
Off-chain protocols are not constrained by block space and may produce many signatures that never appear on the blockchain.
A budget of 2<sup>40</sup> permits approximately 1.1 trillion signatures under a single public key, leaving substantial room for such protocols.

Second, a smaller budget would be easier to exhaust through repeated adversarial signing requests.
An attacker who can request signatures can in principle exhaust any finite signature budget, but a smaller budget makes such an attack more practical.
With a sufficiently small budget, an implementation would need to count signatures persistently and stop signing before the budget was exhausted, making the scheme effectively stateful.
The time required to generate each signature limits how quickly the budget can be exhausted.
Signing devices that require manual approval for every signature cannot feasibly exhaust a 2<sup>40</sup> budget, while automated signers can use rate limiting to make exhaustion impractical.
At a sustained rate of 1,000 signatures per second, producing 2<sup>40</sup> signatures would take approximately 35 years.

### Why not support multiple parameter sets?

The parameters of both SHRINCS components can be tuned to provide different trade-offs among signature size, signature budget, and key-generation, signing, and verification costs.
SHRINCS could therefore allow signers to select among multiple parameter sets at key generation.

SHRINCS instead fixes a single parameter set for both the stateful and stateless components.
This choice has three motivations:

- Misuse resistance. Wallet developers could misunderstand or misuse different parameter sets, or choose unsafe parameters.
- Implementation and integration. Supporting multiple parameter sets would increase verifier implementation complexity and test coverage requirements, make behavior across parameter sets harder to analyze, and complicate resource accounting in protocols that use SHRINCS.
- Privacy. Multiple parameter sets would make wallet fingerprinting easier, reducing anonymity sets across the network.

The selected parameter set balances signature size, signature budget, and key-generation, signing, and verification costs for a broad range of on-chain and off-chain Bitcoin use cases.

### Why these specific parameters?

The stateless parameter set specified here was selected using automated parameter-search and analysis tools.[^sl_param_tool][^sl_param_search]
Among the candidate parameter sets meeting the targeted security level and 2<sup>40</sup> signature budget, the stateless parameter set specified here minimizes signature size subject to keeping its key-generation cost, average signing cost, and worst-case verification cost below those of SLH-DSA-SHA2-128s.

The stateful parameter set specified here keeps its worst-case verification cost per signature byte close to that of the stateless component.
One way the stateful signature size could be reduced further is to increase `WOTS_C_CHAIN_BITS`, which decreases `WOTS_C_CHAIN_COUNT`.
However, this would increase key-generation and signing costs and raise the worst-case verification cost per signature byte above that of the stateless component.

Signatures from both components have a lower worst-case verification cost per byte than BIP340 signatures.
This leaves room for a witness discount that partly compensates for the larger signature size.
Such a discount could increase effective block capacity without a proportional increase in worst-case signature-verification work.
This specification does not define such a discount.

### Why not use a SPHINCS+ variant with smaller signatures for the stateless component?

Using the SLH-DSA algorithms defined in FIPS-205 allows an SLH-DSA implementation that supports custom parameter sets to be adapted for the stateless component specified here with little additional work.
The stateless component also benefits from analysis of these algorithms conducted during the development and standardization of SLH-DSA.

This choice comes at the cost of larger signatures.
For the same 2<sup>40</sup> signature budget, using SPHINCS+C[^sphincs+c] or replacing FORS with PORS+FP[^porsfp] could produce stateless signatures approximately 15% smaller than those specified here.

The ability to reuse SLH-DSA implementations and draw on its existing security analysis justifies this size trade-off.

### Why not a hybrid scheme?

A hybrid signature scheme combines two signature schemes so that it remains unforgeable as long as either component remains unforgeable.
The simplest construction pairs the two public keys, concatenates the two signatures, and accepts only if both signatures verify.
SHRINCS can therefore be used as the post-quantum component of a hybrid without modification, for example together with BIP340.

A dedicated non-black-box combiner can preserve stronger security properties or reduce the combined signature size.
Bird-of-Prey-2[^bop], for example, preserves strong unforgeability when one component is compromised.
Strong unforgeability prevents an attacker from producing a different valid signature for a message for which it has already obtained a valid signature.

This specification does not define a dedicated hybrid signature scheme for the following reasons:

- **Limited additional benefit.** Strong unforgeability does not appear to provide an additional property required for Bitcoin transaction authorization.
  Producing a different valid signature for an already signed transaction neither authorizes a different transaction nor changes its transaction identifier, because witness data is excluded from the transaction identifier.
  For a hybrid of BIP340 and SHRINCS, Bird-of-Prey-2 could reduce the combined signature size by 32 bytes relative to concatenation.[^bop-delving]
- **Complexity.** A Bird-of-Prey-2 combiner for BIP340 and SHRINCS would require modified BIP340 signing and verification algorithms rather than treating BIP340 as a black box.
  It would also require showing that SHRINCS satisfies the requirements imposed on the post-quantum component by the Bird-of-Prey-2 security proof.[^bop]
- **Cryptographic assumptions.** The SHRINCS instance specified here is hash-based and uses SHA256, which BIP340 already relies on for security.
  It therefore does not introduce an entirely new family of cryptographic assumptions.

The limited additional benefits of a dedicated combiner do not justify its complexity.
Applications that want to hedge against state reuse, implementation flaws, or other failures affecting SHRINCS can instead combine it with another signature scheme through concatenation.

### Why NIST security category 1?

The SHRINCS instance specified here targets NIST security category 1 to match BIP340's approximately 128-bit classical security level.[^bip340-security]

The instance of SHRINCS specified here uses 16-byte outputs for its tweakable hash functions and pseudorandom functions, matching the output length used by the SHA2 category 1 parameter sets in FIPS-205.[^slhdsa][^why128]

### Why SHA256 and not some newer hash function?

SHA256 is already part of Bitcoin's consensus rules and fundamental to Bitcoin's security.
Using it for SHRINCS avoids adding another hash function to consensus validation and allows implementations to reuse existing code and any available hardware acceleration.

### Why use WOTS+C in the stateful path?

SLH-DSA signs with WOTS-TW, the Winternitz one-time signature scheme with a checksum.
The stateful path instead uses WOTS+C,[^sphincs+c] a variant that produces smaller signatures.
WOTS+C is not compatible with SLH-DSA, so it is used only on the stateful path, where compatibility is not required.

An alternative choice would be to use WOTS-TW in the stateful path too, which would reduce code surface at the cost of signature size and verification time.
With the parameter set specified here, this would result in stateful signatures up to approximately <!-- CONST START STATEFUL_WOTS_TW_SIZE_INCREASE_PERCENT -->8<!-- CONST END STATEFUL_WOTS_TW_SIZE_INCREASE_PERCENT -->% larger and require more hash computations for verification on average, although the exact number would depend on the signed message.
The additional code complexity appears to be worth the efficiency gains in this case:
The stateful component would be the primary signing tool used in Bitcoin transactions, and thus the WOTS+C optimization is warranted.

### Why statefulness?

Stateful signing is a significant departure from the signature schemes already used in Bitcoin.
Although SHRINCS also supports a stateless path, its stateful path requires signers to keep track of how many times each key pair has been used for stateful signing.
This state-management burden introduces implementation complexity, and incorrect state management can compromise security.

Signers using the stateful component accept this implementation complexity and its associated risks in exchange for smaller signatures and a lower maximum verification cost.
The smallest stateful signature is approximately <!-- CONST START STATEFUL_SIG_SIZE_RATIO -->10.54<!-- CONST END STATEFUL_SIG_SIZE_RATIO --> times smaller than a stateless signature.
Verification of a maximum-depth stateful signature requires <!-- CONST START STATEFUL_VERIFY_COMPRESSIONS_MAX -->509<!-- CONST END STATEFUL_VERIFY_COMPRESSIONS_MAX --> SHA256 compressions.
A stateless signature requires at most <!-- CONST START STATELESS_VERIFY_COMPRESSIONS_MAX -->2792<!-- CONST END STATELESS_VERIFY_COMPRESSIONS_MAX --> SHA256 compressions, approximately <!-- CONST START STATEFUL_VERIFY_SPEED_RATIO -->5.49<!-- CONST END STATEFUL_VERIFY_SPEED_RATIO --> times as many.

### Isn't statefulness unsafe?

The security of stateful signing requires that a state counter value is never reused under the same key pair.
Reusing a state counter value under the same key pair can enable anyone who observes the resulting signatures to produce forgeries.
Implementations can prevent such reuse by enforcing the invariants specified in [On Managing State](#on-managing-state).
Implementations that cannot safely manage state can still generate valid SHRINCS key pairs and sign using the stateless component.
If a key pair's state counter is lost, corrupted, or otherwise uncertain, an implementation MUST refuse stateful signing.
The stateless fallback allows the implementation to do so while always maintaining the ability to sign with that key pair.

State reuse can be detected before publication by comparing a stateful signature with earlier signatures, providing defense in depth against failures in the signer's state management.
Each stateful signature reveals the WOTS+C leaf it uses and can be rejected if the same leaf identifier has previously been observed under the same key pair.
This defense assumes that an honest party performs the check and has access to the earlier signature.
It therefore does not replace the signer's state-management requirements.

### Why does the stateful path use "flexible" XMSS?

SHRINCS uses FXMSS in its stateful component, which supports binary merkle trees of (almost) arbitrary structure.
This is because supporting only one tree shape, such as balanced XMSS (BXMSS) or unbalanced XMSS (UXMSS), locks out some use-cases from using the stateful path.
Balanced and unbalanced XMSS tree shapes have completely different usage profiles and trade-offs against one-another.

| Property | UXMSS | BXMSS |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Keygen speed | Fast | Slow |
| Signature budget | Sign only a few times | Sign many times |
| Signature size | Compact, grows with use | Larger, fixed-size |
| Primary use cases | Personal wallets; single-use certification; cooperative signing | Address reuse; L2 protocols; persistent identity |

SHRINCS verifiers should therefore support either shape, so that the more-efficient stateful component can satisfy the needs of as many users as possible.
After all, verifiers need not care about exactly how many signatures a keypair can produce - They need only validate that a signature is authentic against its public key.

The naive way to support both balanced/unbalanced shapes would be to publish or commit a flag into each SHRINCS public key that identifies whether the stateful component uses balanced or unbalanced XMSS, and then react appropriately to that flag in the verifier.

In SHRINCS, the verifier is agnostic to the stateful XMSS tree structure, which enables a single unified verifier code path that covers any signer's tree, no matter how it is structured.
This "flexible XMSS" (FXMSS) verifier can accept signatures from other more complex XMSS tree structures as well as BXMSS and UXMSS.
This means stateful SHRINCS FXMSS trees can be designed to fit highly specialized use-cases, e.g. a keypair which produces constant size signatures for the first `n` signatures and then the size doubles; or a keypair which produces short signatures of increasing size a la UXMSS, until some threshold point where the signature size locks to a constant size until the rest of the XMSS budget is exhausted.

Many possibilities exist, but this specification prescribes only the BXMSS and UXMSS tree shapes and encourages further research into other tree shapes before suggesting their use in production.
Meanwhile, the FXMSS verifier is left open to accept signatures from unorthodox tree shapes for the sake of forwards compatibility.


### Does FXMSS have a big enough signature budget?

FXMSS admits trees of depth at most <!-- CONST START FXMSS_HEIGHT -->255<!-- CONST END FXMSS_HEIGHT -->, but leaf indexing uses 64-bit unsigned integers, so in theory one could generate a BXMSS tree of at most depth 64 containing 2<sup>64</sup> WOTS+C leaves.
However, this is impractical because FXMSS is a single-tree design XMSS-variant.
A single-tree design puts a fundamental limit on the signer: *The signature budget is limited to the number of WOTS+C keys that can be constructed **up-front,*** during key-generation.
This is because all WOTS+C keys in FXMSS must be arranged into a single merkle tree, whose root must be known before the SHRINCS public key can be fully computed.

Assuming an extremely well-optimized and highly-parallel GPU implementation of WOTS+C key-generation which can execute one SHA256 compression per nanosecond on average, the most WOTS+C keys this signer could generate per second would be about 2<sup>21</sup>, or about 2<sup>32</sup> WOTS+C keys per hour.
Only after generating a suitable number of these WOTS+C keys can SHRINCS key-generation be completed.

Let's be optimistic and assume this high-speed signer allocates one minute for key generation.
She would produce about 115 million WOTS+C keys.
She spends an extra tenth of a second computing the merkle root of all these WOTS+C leaves.
Her FXMSS signature budget would be about 115,000,000.

For the average consumer Bitcoin wallet, this is far more signatures than would ever be needed.

For off-chain protocols, though, the FXMSS signature budget can be exhausted surprisingly fast.
Consider a busy lightning channel which signs 5 new commitment transactions per second on average.
**A signature budget of 115 million would only last 266 days** before the signer would run out of fresh WOTS+C keys, and would need to switch to the stateless path.

Single-tree XMSS could be generalized to *multi-tree XMSS,* written XMSS<sup>MT</sup>, which is specified alongside standard XMSS in RFC-8391[^xmss] as a stateful many-time hash-based signature scheme.
XMSS<sup>MT</sup> allows signers to use SPHINCS-style hypertrees to keep key-generation performance bounded while supporting very large signature budgets.

SHRINCS opts not to support XMSS<sup>MT</sup>, due to the additional code complexity, attack surface, and challenging security interplay with flexible tree structures that would be introduced.
High-frequency off-chain use-cases can be handled adequately by the stateless component of SHRINCS, which has sufficient signature budget (2<sup>40</sup>) to allow a 1000 TPS Lightning channel to operate continuously for over 30 years.
The additional size of stateless signatures only becomes a problem in rare non-cooperative edge cases where force-closures are needed.


### What about hardware wallets?

Low-power signers, especially early-generation hardware wallets, typically lack the fast and highly-parallel computing hardware needed for efficient key-generation and signing in a hash-based signature scheme.[^ledger-bench][^trezor-bench]

Thankfully, signing with the stateful component of SHRINCS is very efficient and requires about <!-- CONST START UXMSS_255_SIGN_COMPRESSIONS_AVG -->133326<!-- CONST END UXMSS_255_SIGN_COMPRESSIONS_AVG --> hash invocations per signature for UXMSS.
Most of that work can be cached up-front during the stateful key-generation, which only requires about <!-- CONST START UXMSS_255_KEYGEN_COMPRESSIONS_STATEFUL_ONLY -->133631<!-- CONST END UXMSS_255_KEYGEN_COMPRESSIONS_STATEFUL_ONLY --> SHA256 compressions - and even that can be reduced by decreasing the UXMSS tree depth.

The stateless component is much harder for low-power signers to work with because its parameters are more-or-less fixed, and it requires about <!-- CONST START STATELESS_SIGN_COMPRESSIONS_AVG -->1707229<!-- CONST END STATELESS_SIGN_COMPRESSIONS_AVG --> SHA256 compressions to sign.
To remedy this, hardware wallets can implement a software-level trade-off in SLH-DSA called *hypertree pruning*[^pruning] which reduces the secure signature budget of the key from 2<sup>40</sup> to some arbitrary lower bound, in exchange for significantly faster signing and key-generation.

Since these hardware wallets typically have very weak processing power and require human interaction to produce a set of signatures, a signature budget of 2<sup>40</sup> is already overkill in this context, and so can safely be reduced while preserving the stateless property of SLH-DSA (assuming the key is not exported to a higher-power signing device).

Implementations using hypertree pruning must reproduce the same pruning strategy when regenerating a key.

### Key Generation Inputs
<!-- TODO (Jonas): What's the purpose of having this section here? Why not explain this in the keygen algorithm section? -->

Generating a SHRINCS key is straightforward and consists only of generating 48 random bytes.
This is then split into 3 x 16-byte seeds.

- `sk_seed` is the core component of the secret key. Exposing this compromises the security of the keypair.
- `sk_prf` is a secret value used to derive per-message randomness.
- `pk_seed` is the public seed included in the public key.

Note this is the bare minimum needed to generate a full SHRINCS public key.
More performant (but larger) secret key representations are possible.


#### Padding

To save computational effort, `pk_seed` is padded with zero bytes to a length of 64 bytes in most cases.
This aligns with the SHA256 block size, so that `pk_seed` can be absorbed into the SHA256 state, and that midstate can be cached & reused.


### Value Types

A function signature states the size of each value it takes and returns, in the notation below.
`impl/shrincs.py` declares that notation as [`typing.Annotated`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Annotated) metadata, so that it can be checked mechanically.
They are inert in the implementation, and the sizes they state are requirements on any implementation.

- `Bytes[n]` is a byte string of exactly `n` bytes.
  `n` may be an arithmetic expression over the constants this document defines, evaluated for the parameter set in force, as in `Bytes[2 + WOTS_C_CHAINS_SIZE]`.
- `Bytes[a:b]` is a byte string of at least `a` and at most `b` bytes.
  Both bounds are inclusive, unlike a Python slice.
  Either may be omitted: `Bytes[a:]` is at least `a` bytes, and `Bytes[:b]` at most `b`.
- A bare `bytes` is bounded only by its callers.
- `UInt8`, `UInt16`, `UInt32` and `UInt64` are integers in the ranges `[0, 2**8)`, `[0, 2**16)`, `[0, 2**32)` and `[0, 2**64)` respectively, serialized as described in [Utilities](#utilities).
  A bare `int` is an integer of unbounded width, and no value in this specification is negative.
- `Array[T, n]` is a sequence of exactly `n` values of type `T`.
  `n` may be an arithmetic expression over the constants this document defines, as it may in `Bytes[n]`.
- `list[T]` is a sequence of values of type `T`, as many of them as the paragraph beneath the signature states.
- `tuple[...]` is a fixed group of values of the given types, in that order, returned by the functions which produce more than one.
  Each element is written into the field its caller gives it, so the group has no size of its own.
- `Union[T, U]` is a value of one of the given types.
  Where this specification returns one, its length tells the reader which.
- `Optional[T]` is either a `T` or the absence of one.
- `bool` is true or false, and is never serialized.
- `bytearray` is the 22-byte address described under [ADRS](#adrs).
  It is the one value a function modifies in place, which is why it is not given a size here.

These sizes are normative.
A value is written into a field wide enough to hold it.
Writing one into a narrower field is an error rather than a value reduced to fit, and every field this specification writes is wide enough for every value which can reach it.


### Utilities

We make use of the following utility helper functions in specifying SHRINCS.

- `a // b`: divides the integer `a` by the integer `b`, rounding the quotient down.
- `ceildiv(a, b)`: divides the integer `a` by the integer `b`, rounding the quotient up.
- `sum(x)`: sums a sequence of numbers `x`.
- `replicate(b, n)`: returns a bytestring of length `n` containing only the repeated byte `b`.
- `zeros(n)`: returns a bytestring of length `n` containing only repeated zero bytes.
- `range(start, end)`: returns the ascending sequence of all integers `i` such that `start <= i < end`.
- `concat(array)`: concatenates an array of byte strings.

Every algorithm and every derived constant in this specification is computed with exact integer arithmetic.
Division in them appears only in the two integer forms above, so the specification never leaves a rounding decision to the implementation.
Note that `ceildiv(a, b)` must round up for every `a` it is given: writing it as a division that rounds toward zero, which is what the division operator does in most languages, would silently round down instead.

Every quantity in this specification denotes a mathematical integer, and every operation on one is exact.
Nothing overflows, underflows, wraps, is reduced modulo a word size, saturates, or is truncated; a difference is never clamped at zero, and the only rounding is that of the two division forms above.
If an operation would produce a result outside the range specified for that value, the operation violates the specification.
It does not produce a different value within the range.

The [value types](#value-types) above are therefore refinements, not representations.
`UInt8` through `UInt64` assert that a value lies in `[0, 2**8)` through `[0, 2**64)`.
They do not make it a machine word, and no arithmetic is ever performed modulo `2**bits`.

Unless stated otherwise, all integers are serialized to and parsed from bytes as fixed-width, big-endian (network byte order) values, where the width is the size of the byte field the integer occupies.


#### `base_2b(...)`

<!-- DOC START base_2b -->
Decomposes the bytes `x` into `outlen` groups of `b` bits which are each
parsed as an integer in the range `[0, 2**b)`. The leading `outlen * b` bits
of `x` are parsed, and so `x` must have accordingly sufficient length.

```py
def base_2b(x: bytes, b: int, outlen: int) -> list[int]:
  assert len(x) >= ceildiv(outlen * b, 8)

  baseb = [0] * outlen # output array
  j = 0                # counts the bytes read from the input x.
  acc = 0              # accumulator, collects bits from x
  bits_filled = 0      # counts the bits accumulated

  for i in range(outlen):
    while bits_filled < b:
      acc = (acc << 8) + x[j]
      j += 1
      bits_filled += 8

    bits_filled -= b
    baseb[i] = acc >> bits_filled
    acc %= 2**bits_filled # prevent accumulator from overflowing

  return baseb
```
<!-- DOC END base_2b -->


### Building Blocks

SHRINCS is a high-level construction built out of many smaller sub-schemes.
To fully specify SHRINCS we start by defining the lowest level building blocks - addresses and the _hash functions_ and _pseudorandom functions_ (PRFs) - followed by the one-time signature schemes WOTS-TW and WOTS+C, and then the few-time signature scheme FORS, and finally we will move on to the higher-level constructions like XMSS and SLH-DSA, which together form SHRINCS.

```
     ADRS
        \
      hash functions
          & PRFs
        /         \
       /         /   \
      /         /      \
   WOTS+C   WOTS-TW   FORS
    /           \      /
   /             \    /
 FXMSS           SLH-DSA
    \        (contains XMSS)
     \           /
      \         /
       \       /
        SHRINCS
```


### ADRS

A critical security property of SHRINCS and its components is that every hash function invocation used in the verification algorithm must be _unique,_ so that inputs used in one hash function cannot be reused to produce the same output in another hash function.

To accomplish this goal, we will use _tweakable hash functions_ (explained below) which modify a hash function with some context-dependent location information.
This unambiguously specifies the exact instance of the hash function in the signing/verification algorithms where the hash function is being used.
This location is called an _address_ and we encode it into a 22-byte array, often called an `ADRS`.[^adrs]

#### ADRS Payloads

Each `ADRS` type gives different contextual meaning to the 12 bytes of the ADRS `payload` field.
The following table describes how they are used under each ADRS type flag.

| Stateless `ADRS` Type | Payload Format | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Stateful `ADRS` Type | Payload Format |

The following figures show, for each `ADRS` type, how the 22-byte address is laid out: the common leading fields (`layer` and `tree_address` for stateless types, `node_height` and `node_index` for stateful types) and the `type` field, followed by the type-specific interpretation of the 12-byte `payload`.
Field widths are drawn proportional to their byte sizes, with byte offsets along the top.

### Hash and Pseudorandom Functions

SHRINCS builds all of these functions from SHA256 as the base hash function, which we invoke as the primitive function `sha256(x)`, returning a 32-byte array.
Outputs are often truncated, which we denote using Pythonic list-slicing notation: `sha256(x)[:16]`.

<!-- DOC START sha256 -->
The `sha256` hash function.

- Inputs:
  - `message`: a message of at most `2**61 - 1` bytes.
- Output:
  - a 32-byte hash.

```py
def sha256(message: Bytes[:2**61 - 1]) -> Bytes[32]:
  return hashlib.sha256(bytes(message)).digest()
```
<!-- DOC END sha256 -->

SHA-256 accepts an input of at most `2**61 - 1` bytes: its padding encodes the message length in a 64-bit field that counts bits, so the input cannot exceed `2**64 - 1` bits.
HMAC-SHA256 prepends a single 64-byte block to the message before hashing it, so `hmac_sha256` accepts at most `2**61 - 1 - 64` bytes.
These two primitive limits are the root of every message-length bound in the scheme; the resulting cap on a SHRINCS message is derived in [Maximum Message Length](#maximum-message-length).

These functions fall into three families, described in the following sections: _tweakable hash functions_, _pseudorandom functions_, and _message digest functions_.
Though built on the same primitive, they play conceptually distinct roles and are relied on for different security properties.


#### Tweakable Hash Functions

A tweakable hash function can be thought of as a hash function which supports additional independent parameters that scope it to a specific role.
Concretely, each invocation is parameterized by a public parameter, `pk_seed`, and a tweak, the `ADRS`, so that the same input hashed at two different positions yields unrelated outputs.


##### `T_sl(...)`

<!-- DOC START T_sl -->
The `T_sl` tweaked hash function. Compresses `WOTS_TW_CHAIN_COUNT` Winternitz chain tips into a
single 16-byte hash.

- Inputs:
  - `pk_seed`: a 16-byte public seed.
  - `ADRS`: a 22-byte address.
  - `M_l`: a `WOTS_TW_CHAINS_SIZE`-byte concatenation of chain tips.
- Output:
  - a 16-byte hash.

This function is only used in the stateless path, and by both the signer and the verifier.

```py
def T_sl(pk_seed: Bytes[16], ADRS: bytearray, M_l: Bytes[WOTS_TW_CHAINS_SIZE]) -> Bytes[16]:
  return sha256(pk_seed + zeros(48) + ADRS + M_l)[:16]
```
<!-- DOC END T_sl -->


##### `T_sf(...)`

<!-- DOC START T_sf -->
The `T_sf` tweaked hash function. Compresses `WOTS_C_CHAIN_COUNT` Winternitz chain tips into a
single 16-byte hash.

- Inputs:
  - `pk_seed`: a 16-byte public seed.
  - `ADRS`: a 22-byte address.
  - `M_l`: a `WOTS_C_CHAINS_SIZE`-byte concatenation of chain tips.
- Output:
  - a 16-byte hash.

This function is only used in the stateful path, and by both the signer and the verifier.

```py
def T_sf(pk_seed: Bytes[16], ADRS: bytearray, M_l: Bytes[WOTS_C_CHAINS_SIZE]) -> Bytes[16]:
  return sha256(pk_seed + zeros(48) + ADRS + M_l)[:16]
```
<!-- DOC END T_sf -->


##### `T_k(...)`

<!-- DOC START T_k -->
The `T_k` tweaked hash function. Compresses `SPHX_FORS_COUNT` FORS tree roots into a single
16-byte hash.

- Inputs:
  - `pk_seed`: a 16-byte public seed.
  - `ADRS`: a 22-byte address.
  - `M_k`: a `SPHX_FORS_COUNT * 16`-byte concatenation of FORS tree roots.
- Output:
  - a 16-byte hash.

This function is only used in the stateless path, and by both the signer and the verifier.

```py
def T_k(pk_seed: Bytes[16], ADRS: bytearray, M_k: Bytes[SPHX_FORS_COUNT * 16]) -> Bytes[16]:
  return sha256(pk_seed + zeros(48) + ADRS + M_k)[:16]
```
<!-- DOC END T_k -->


##### `F(...)`

<!-- DOC START F -->
The `F` tweaked hash function. Hashes a single 16-byte input, to generate and iterate Winternitz
hash chains and to hash FORS leaves.

- Inputs:
  - `pk_seed`: a 16-byte public seed.
  - `ADRS`: a 22-byte address.
  - `M_1`: a 16-byte hash.
- Output:
  - a 16-byte hash.

This function is used in both stateful and stateless paths, and by both the signer and the verifier.

```py
def F(pk_seed: Bytes[16], ADRS: bytearray, M_1: Bytes[16]) -> Bytes[16]:
  return sha256(pk_seed + zeros(48) + ADRS + M_1)[:16]
```
<!-- DOC END F -->


##### `H(...)`

<!-- DOC START H -->
The `H` tweaked hash function. Combines a pair of 16-byte Merkle child nodes into their 16-byte
parent, building the Merkle trees in XMSS and FORS.

- Inputs:
  - `pk_seed`: a 16-byte public seed.
  - `ADRS`: a 22-byte address.
  - `M_2`: a 32-byte concatenation of two child node hashes.
- Output:
  - a 16-byte hash.

This function is used in both stateful and stateless paths, and by both the signer and the verifier.

```py
def H(pk_seed: Bytes[16], ADRS: bytearray, M_2: Bytes[32]) -> Bytes[16]:
  return sha256(pk_seed + zeros(48) + ADRS + M_2)[:16]
```
<!-- DOC END H -->


##### `H_grind(...)`

<!-- DOC START H_grind -->
The `H_grind` tweaked hash function. Maps a 32-byte `digest` and grinding `counter` into the
constant-sum message space for WOTS+C.

- Inputs:
  - `pk_seed`: a 16-byte public seed.
  - `ADRS`: a 22-byte address.
  - `digest`: a 32-byte digest.
  - `counter`: a 16-bit unsigned integer.
- Output:
  - a 16-byte hash.

This function is only used in the stateful path, and by both the signer and the verifier.

```py
def H_grind(pk_seed: Bytes[16], ADRS: bytearray, digest: Bytes[32], counter: UInt16) -> Bytes[16]:
  assert counter <= 0xFFFF
  return sha256(pk_seed + zeros(48) + ADRS[:10] + digest + zeros(4) + counter.to_bytes(2))[:16]
```
<!-- DOC END H_grind -->

The extra 4 bytes of padding before the counter ensures the counter lines up with the SHA256 message schedule boundaries.

Notice we only use the first 10 bytes of `ADRS`.
This ensures the entire hash input fits inside a single SHA256 compression call, given the cached `pk_seed` input.
The remaining 12 bytes are always zero padding.


#### Pseudorandom Functions

A _pseudorandom function_ produces output indistinguishable from random to anyone who does not know its key.
SHRINCS instantiates its two pseudorandom functions as _keyed hash functions_, that is, hash functions that take a dedicated key input alongside the message.
Both are keyed by a secret: `PRF` is keyed by `sk_seed` and derives secret key material, while `PRF_msg` is keyed by `sk_prf` and derives the per-message randomizer.
`PRF_msg` comes in a stateless and a stateful variant, `PRF_msg_sl` and `PRF_msg_sf`, both built on HMAC-SHA256[^hmac], which we invoke as the function `hmac_sha256(key, message)`.

##### `hmac_sha256(...)`

<!-- DOC START hmac_sha256 -->
The `hmac_sha256` keyed hash function.

- Inputs:
  - `key`: a key of at most 64 bytes.
  - `message`: a message of at most `2**61 - 1 - 64` bytes.
- Output:
  - a 32-byte hash.

```py
def hmac_sha256(key: Bytes[:64], message: Bytes[:2**61 - 1 - 64]) -> Bytes[32]:
  assert len(key) <= 64
  padded_key = key + zeros(64 - len(key))
  inner = sha256(xor(padded_key, replicate(0x36, 64)) + message)
  return sha256(xor(padded_key, replicate(0x5C, 64)) + inner)
```
<!-- DOC END hmac_sha256 -->


##### `PRF(...)`

<!-- DOC START PRF -->
The `PRF` pseudorandom function. Derives a secret 16-byte preimage from `sk_seed`, for signing
and key generation.

- Inputs:
  - `pk_seed`: a 16-byte public seed.
  - `sk_seed`: a 16-byte secret.
  - `ADRS`: a 22-byte address.
- Output:
  - a 16-byte hash.

This function is used in both stateful and stateless paths, but only by the signer.

```py
def PRF(pk_seed: Bytes[16], sk_seed: Bytes[16], ADRS: bytearray) -> Bytes[16]:
  return sha256(pk_seed + zeros(48) + ADRS + sk_seed)[:16]
```
<!-- DOC END PRF -->

Note the order of the arguments passed to `PRF` is _not_ the same order in which those arguments are processed by `sha256`.
This aligns with definitions in FIPS-205[^slhdsa].


##### `PRF_msg_sl(...)`

<!-- DOC START PRF_msg_sl -->
The `PRF_msg_sl` pseudorandom function. Derives the per-message randomizer for the stateless path via
HMAC-SHA256.

- Inputs:
  - `sk_prf`: a 16-byte secret.
  - `opt_rand`: a 16-byte value.
  - `M`: a variable-length message.
- Output:
  - a 16-byte hash.

This function is only used in the stateless path, and only by the signer.

`opt_rand` is set to either `pk_seed` (giving the "deterministic variant" of SLH-DSA[^slhdsa]),
or a 16-byte random value sampled from a secure RNG (the "hedged variant" of SLH-DSA, which increases
resistance to side-channel attacks).

```py
def PRF_msg_sl(sk_prf: Bytes[16], opt_rand: Bytes[16], M: bytes) -> Bytes[16]:
  return hmac_sha256(key=sk_prf, message=opt_rand + M)[:16]
```
<!-- DOC END PRF_msg_sl -->


##### `PRF_msg_sf(...)`

<!-- DOC START PRF_msg_sf -->
The `PRF_msg_sf` function. Derives the per-message randomizer for the stateful path via
HMAC-SHA256.

- Inputs:
  - `sk_prf`: a 16-byte secret.
  - `pk_seed`: a 16-byte public seed.
  - `ADRS`: a 22-byte address.
  - `M`: a variable-length message.
- Output:
  - a 16-byte hash.

This function is only used in the stateful path, and only by the signer.

```py
def PRF_msg_sf(sk_prf: Bytes[16], pk_seed: Bytes[16], ADRS: bytearray, M: bytes) -> Bytes[16]:
  return hmac_sha256(key=sk_prf + replicate(0xFF, 48), message=pk_seed + ADRS[:9] + M)[:16]
```
<!-- DOC END PRF_msg_sf -->

The `sk_prf` is padded with `0xFF` up until it is 64 bytes long.
This ensures domain separation between stateful and stateless paths.

We remove the randomization input option for the stateful path compared to `PRF_msg_sl` as the same WOTS+C instance can sign a message only once, but in a misuse scenario where the same message is queried for a signature under the same state, producing exactly the same signature will not constitute a forgery.

We only use the first 9 bytes of `ADRS`, because these bytes encode the position of the WOTS+C leaf in the FXMSS tree.


#### Message Digest Functions

Signing does not hash the user's message directly.
Instead, the message is compressed together with a randomizer `R` into a short digest, which the one-time and few-time signatures then sign.
SHRINCS uses a different digest function on each path.
The stateless `H_msg_sl` is a keyed hash function, keyed by `R`.
The stateful `H_msg_sf` additionally binds the position of the signing leaf, and so takes a tweak (the `ADRS`) in addition to `R`; it is therefore a tweakable hash function rather than a plain keyed hash.

##### `H_msg_sl(...)`

<!-- DOC START H_msg_sl -->
The `H_msg_sl` message hash function. Produces the 32-byte signing digest for the stateless path.

- Inputs:
  - `R`: a 16-byte randomizer.
  - `pk_seed`: a 16-byte public seed.
  - `sl_root`: the 16-byte stateless root hash.
  - `M`: a variable-length message.
- Output:
  - a 32-byte hash.

This function is only used in the stateless path, and by both the signer and the verifier.

Note that `pk_seed` is not padded in this keyed hash function.

```py
def H_msg_sl(R: Bytes[16], pk_seed: Bytes[16], sl_root: Bytes[16], M: bytes) -> Bytes[32]:
  return sha256(R + pk_seed + sha256(R + pk_seed + sl_root + M) + zeros(4))
```
<!-- DOC END H_msg_sl -->

The outer hash computes the first 32-byte MGF1-SHA-256 block.
`slh_dsa_digest_message` consumes its first `m = 24` bytes, which match the FIPS-205 definition for this parameter set.[^slhdsa][^mgf1]


##### `H_msg_sf(...)`

<!-- DOC START H_msg_sf -->
The `H_msg_sf` message hash function. Produces the 32-byte signing digest for the stateful path.

- Inputs:
  - `R`: a 16-byte randomizer.
  - `pk_seed`: a 16-byte public seed.
  - `sf_root`: the 16-byte stateful root hash.
  - `ADRS`: a 22-byte address.
  - `M`: a variable-length message.
- Output:
  - a 32-byte hash.

This function is only used in the stateful path, and by both the signer and the verifier.

Note that `pk_seed` is not padded in this tweakable hash function.

```py
def H_msg_sf(
    R: Bytes[16], pk_seed: Bytes[16], sf_root: Bytes[16], ADRS: bytearray, M: bytes
) -> Bytes[32]:
  return sha256(R + pk_seed + sha256(R + pk_seed + sf_root + ADRS[:9] + M) + ADRS[:9])
```
<!-- DOC END H_msg_sf -->

Notice we only use the first 9 bytes of `ADRS`, because these bytes encode the position of the WOTS+C leaf in the FXMSS tree.

Unlike `H_msg_sl`, `H_msg_sf` is specific to the stateful component and therefore need not match the definition of `H_msg` in FIPS-205[^slhdsa].
This accounts for two intentional differences from `H_msg_sl`:

- There is no trailing 4-byte zero-padding on the outer hash.
  That padding exists only to make `H_msg_sl` match the MGF1-SHA-256[^mgf1] definition mandated by FIPS-205, which does not apply here.
- The WOTS+C leaf position given by `ADRS` is bound into both the inner and outer hash inputs.
  This domain-separates the stateful digest by the leaf used to sign it.


#### Implementation Notes

- The only difference between `T_sf`, `T_sl`, `T_k`, `F`, and `H` is the byte-length of the third input parameter.
  They are defined as different hash functions for security.
- `PRF_msg_sl` may be replaced with an XOF such as MGF1-SHA-256 or SHAKE256, from which the caller can sample multiple randomizers for the purposes of grinding to implement hypertree pruning[^pruning] more efficiently.
  For security, the XOF itself needs to provide the required security guarantees of a PRF, and the XOF should absorb the same inputs as `PRF_msg_sl`.
- `F(...)` is the most performance-critical hash function to optimize, as it dominates the runtime of signing, keygen, and verification.
- The padded `pk_seed` should be absorbed into a SHA256 midstate which is cached and reused.
  **This doubles performance.**
- These tweakable hash functions often handle secret inputs like `sk_seed`, so implementations should be free of control flows which branch and leak side-channel information based on potentially-secret data.
  Inputs should not be copied in memory unless securely erased afterwards.
- Many of these hash functions are invoked on independent data, and so can be run in parallel.
  Platforms with access to vectorized (SIMD) instruction sets on x86[^simd_x86] or ARM[^simd_arm] CPUs may utilize them to parallelize SHA256[^sha256x8] to improve performance significantly: a factor of 4 or more in some cases.
- Implementors can use SHA2 hardware acceleration[^sha_ni], though this is best used to accelerate verification, not signing or keygen[^sha_ni_bench].


### WOTS Schemes

A _one-time signature_ (OTS) scheme restricts signers to creating at most one signature per keypair.
If this assumption is broken by publishing distinct signatures, then adversaries will be capable of forging new ones.
While limited in their practical utility, hash-based OTS schemes are a crucial building block to construct more advanced hash-based signature schemes.

The following two sections describe a pair of related one-time signature schemes: WOTS-TW and WOTS+C.

- WOTS+C is used for the stateful signing path.
- WOTS-TW is used for the stateless signing path.

Both WOTS-TW and WOTS+C are variants of the original _Winternitz one-time signature scheme_ (WOTS),[^merkle] but each has a distinct performance profile and features.
WOTS-TW is standardized in SLH-DSA[^slhdsa] and so we use it to preserve compatibility.
WOTS+C produces shorter signatures with faster and constant-work verification, but is not compatible with SLH-DSA and so we only use it on the stateful path where compatibility is not a concern.
WOTS+C can also technically fail when signing, a rare edge case which parameters must be carefully engineered to avoid.


#### Informal Description

Here follows an intuitive description of Winternitz OTS (WOTS) schemes in general.

A WOTS private key is an array of secret preimages.
Each preimage is hashed, and the output is then hashed again, and so on, forming a _chain_ of hashes.
After some prescribed number of steps in the chain (iterating the hash function) we reach the _tip_ of the hash chain.
The _tips_ of those hash chains form the Winternitz public key.

To sign, the key holder maps an approved message to a set of integers which each index a node in a hash chain, and reveals the hashes at those indexes as the Winternitz signature.

The verifier maps the message to those same integers as the signer did, and finishes computing the hash chains.
If the signer revealed the correct nodes, then the verifier will have recomputed the same hash chain tips that compose the signer's public key.

<img src="img/wots-diagram-generic.svg">

<sup>This diagram illustrates a simplified example of WOTS, using 4 hash chains of length 4 to sign an 8-bit message.</sup>

As written, this would be insecure: Adversaries could forge signatures by finding a message which maps to a higher set of indexes.
WOTS-TW and WOTS+C differ only in their solutions to this problem: WOTS-TW appends additional "checksum" hash chains, while WOTS+C appends a two-byte counter which the signer must grind to find a set of indexes which sum to a specific constant.


### WOTS Algorithm

Both WOTS schemes iterate their hash chains the same way, differing only in the `ADRS` type the steps are tweaked by.
Each scheme therefore has its own chaining function, which sets that type itself rather than leaving it to every caller.


#### `wots_tw_chain_iter(...)`

<!-- DOC START wots_tw_chain_iter -->
The WOTS-TW hash chain iteration function. Iterates the hash chain from index `start` by `steps`
steps, returning the node at index `start + steps`. The `ADRS` must be prefilled with the keypair
and chain the node belongs to.

- Inputs:
  - `node`: a 16-byte hash.
  - `start`: a 32-bit unsigned integer, the index of `node` in its hash chain, less than
    `2**WOTS_TW_CHAIN_BITS`.
  - `steps`: a 32-bit unsigned integer, the number of steps to take up the chain; `start + steps`
    must not exceed `2**WOTS_TW_CHAIN_BITS - 1`.
  - `pk_seed`: a 16-byte public seed.
  - `ADRS`: a 22-byte address.
- Output:
  - a 16-byte hash at index `start + steps`.

This function is only used in the stateless path, and by both the signer and the verifier.

```py
def wots_tw_chain_iter(
    node: Bytes[16], start: UInt32, steps: UInt32, pk_seed: Bytes[16], ADRS: bytearray
) -> Bytes[16]:
  ADRS[9] = SL_WOTS_TW_HASH
  for j in range(start, start+steps):
    ADRS[18:22] = j.to_bytes(4)
    node = F(pk_seed, ADRS, node)
  return node
```
<!-- DOC END wots_tw_chain_iter -->


#### `wots_c_chain_iter(...)`

<!-- DOC START wots_c_chain_iter -->
The WOTS+C hash chain iteration function. Iterates the hash chain from index `start` by `steps`
steps, returning the node at index `start + steps`. The `ADRS` must be prefilled with the keypair
and chain the node belongs to.

- Inputs:
  - `node`: a 16-byte hash.
  - `start`: a 32-bit unsigned integer, the index of `node` in its hash chain, less than
    `2**WOTS_C_CHAIN_BITS`.
  - `steps`: a 32-bit unsigned integer, the number of steps to take up the chain; `start + steps`
    must not exceed `2**WOTS_C_CHAIN_BITS - 1`.
  - `pk_seed`: a 16-byte public seed.
  - `ADRS`: a 22-byte address.
- Output:
  - a 16-byte hash at index `start + steps`.

This function is only used in the stateful path, and by both the signer and the verifier.

```py
def wots_c_chain_iter(
    node: Bytes[16], start: UInt32, steps: UInt32, pk_seed: Bytes[16], ADRS: bytearray
) -> Bytes[16]:
  ADRS[9] = SF_WOTS_C_HASH
  for j in range(start, start+steps):
    ADRS[18:22] = j.to_bytes(4)
    node = F(pk_seed, ADRS, node)
  return node
```
<!-- DOC END wots_c_chain_iter -->


### WOTS-TW

WOTS-TW is the classic variant of Winternitz one-time signatures[^merkle] which uses a checksum to prevent forgeries.
In WOTS-TW, a 128-bit message is mapped directly into an array of `WOTS_TW_CHAIN_COUNT1` hash chain indexes, and the checksum is simply the negation of the sum of those indexes.
This checksum is then encoded into `WOTS_TW_CHAIN_COUNT2` hash chain indexes which are appended to the message indexes before signing and verification.

This process starts by breaking a 128-bit message into `WOTS_TW_CHAIN_COUNT1` integers of `WOTS_TW_CHAIN_BITS` bits each in the range `[0, 2**WOTS_TW_CHAIN_BITS)`.
The maximum possible sum of those indexes would be if every index was equal to `2**WOTS_TW_CHAIN_BITS - 1`, so the maximum sum is

```py
WOTS_TW_CHECKSUM_MAX = WOTS_TW_CHAIN_COUNT1 * (2**WOTS_TW_CHAIN_BITS - 1)
```

This constant is also defined explicitly in the earlier [table of derived constants](#derived-constants).

Given an array of `msg_indexes`, the checksum can be computed by:

```py
checksum = WOTS_TW_CHECKSUM_MAX - sum(msg_indexes)
```

This checksum is then converted into `WOTS_TW_CHAIN_COUNT2` integers of `WOTS_TW_CHAIN_BITS` bits each, which are appended to the original `msg_indexes`.


#### `wots_tw_message_to_indexes(...)`

<!-- DOC START wots_tw_message_to_indexes -->
The WOTS-TW message map function. Converts a 16-byte `message` into a checksummed array of
`WOTS_TW_CHAIN_COUNT` chain indexes in `[0, 2**WOTS_TW_CHAIN_BITS)`.

- Inputs:
  - `message`: a 16-byte hash.
- Output:
  - a checksummed array of `WOTS_TW_CHAIN_COUNT` `WOTS_TW_CHAIN_BITS`-bit unsigned integers.

This function is only used in the stateless path, and by both the signer and the verifier.

```py
def wots_tw_message_to_indexes(message: Bytes[16]) -> Array[UInt16, WOTS_TW_CHAIN_COUNT]:
  msg_indexes = base_2b(message, WOTS_TW_CHAIN_BITS, WOTS_TW_CHAIN_COUNT1)
  checksum = WOTS_TW_CHECKSUM_MAX - sum(msg_indexes)

  checksum_indexes = [0] * WOTS_TW_CHAIN_COUNT2
  for i in range(WOTS_TW_CHAIN_COUNT2):
    checksum_indexes[WOTS_TW_CHAIN_COUNT2 - 1 - i] = checksum % (2**WOTS_TW_CHAIN_BITS)
    checksum >>= WOTS_TW_CHAIN_BITS

  return msg_indexes + checksum_indexes
```
<!-- DOC END wots_tw_message_to_indexes -->

<!-- DOC START wots_tw_message_to_indexes_alt -->
Alternative implementation, equivalent to `wots_tw_message_to_indexes` but using the
more complex FIPS-205 algorithm.

```py
def wots_tw_message_to_indexes_alt(message: Bytes[16]) -> Array[UInt16, WOTS_TW_CHAIN_COUNT]:
  SPHX_WOTS_CHECKSUM_SHIFT = (8 - (WOTS_TW_CHAIN_BITS * WOTS_TW_CHAIN_COUNT2) % 8) % 8
  SPHX_WOTS_CHECKSUM_BYTE_LEN = ceildiv(WOTS_TW_CHAIN_COUNT2 * WOTS_TW_CHAIN_BITS, 8)
  msg_indexes = base_2b(message, WOTS_TW_CHAIN_BITS, WOTS_TW_CHAIN_COUNT1)
  checksum = (WOTS_TW_CHECKSUM_MAX - sum(msg_indexes)) << SPHX_WOTS_CHECKSUM_SHIFT
  checksum_bytes = checksum.to_bytes(SPHX_WOTS_CHECKSUM_BYTE_LEN)
  checksum_indexes = base_2b(checksum_bytes, WOTS_TW_CHAIN_BITS, WOTS_TW_CHAIN_COUNT2)
  return msg_indexes + checksum_indexes
```
<!-- DOC END wots_tw_message_to_indexes_alt -->

This algorithm is used by both signer and verifier, and **it is security-critical for both implementations to match.**

Note especially how the _low-order_ bits of the checksum are shifted off first, and they are inserted snugly at the very end of the checksum indexes, with some padding bits which are always zero in between them and the message indexes.
The checksum bits are NOT appended directly to the message indexes.


##### Example

Consider the following message indexes:

```py
msg = [10, 11, 2, 2, 3, 12, 15, 8, 1, 2, 8, 2, 2, 10, 9, 13, 10, 11, 2, 2, 3, 12, 15, 8, 1, 2, 8, 2, 2, 10, 9, 13]
```

The checksum of these message indexes is:

```py
checksum = WOTS_TW_CHECKSUM_MAX - sum(msg)
         = 260
         = 0b100000100
```

The original message has a binary representation:

```
1010 1011 0010 ... 1010 1001 1101
```


After appending the checksum, the final checksummed index sequence should look like this:

```
1010 1011 0010 ... 1010 1001 1101 0001 0000 0100
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                     checksum
```


#### `wots_tw_pubkey_gen(...)`

<!-- DOC START wots_tw_pubkey_gen -->

keypair location prefilled in `ADRS`.

- Inputs:
  - `sk_seed`: a 16-byte secret.
  - `pk_seed`: a 16-byte public seed.
  - `ADRS`: a 22-byte address.
- Output:
  - a 16-byte hash representing the WOTS-TW public key.

This function is only used in the stateless path, and only by the signer.

  ADRS[14:22] = zeros(8)
  wots_pk_hash = T_sl(pk_seed, ADRS, concat(wots_pk))
  return wots_pk_hash
```
<!-- DOC END wots_tw_pubkey_gen -->


#### `wots_tw_sign(...)`

<!-- DOC START wots_tw_sign -->
The WOTS-TW signing function. Produces a WOTS-TW signature on a 16-byte `message`, at the keypair
location prefilled in `ADRS`.

- Inputs:
  - `message`: a 16-byte message to sign.
  - `sk_seed`: a 16-byte secret.
  - `pk_seed`: a 16-byte public seed.
  - `ADRS`: a 22-byte address.
- Output:
  - a `WOTS_TW_CHAINS_SIZE`-byte signature.

This function is only used in the stateless path, and only by the signer.

```py

    message: Bytes[16], sk_seed: Bytes[16], pk_seed: Bytes[16], ADRS: bytearray
) -> Bytes[WOTS_TW_CHAINS_SIZE]:

    ADRS[14:18] = i.to_bytes(4)  # chain index
    ADRS[18:22] = zeros(4) # zero hash index
    sk = PRF(pk_seed, sk_seed, ADRS)
    signature[i] = wots_tw_chain_iter(sk, 0, indexes[i], pk_seed, ADRS)
  return concat(signature)
```
<!-- DOC END wots_tw_sign -->


#### `wots_tw_pubkey_from_sig(...)`

<!-- DOC START wots_tw_pubkey_from_sig -->
The WOTS-TW verification function. Recovers a WOTS-TW public key from a `signature` on a 16-byte
`message`.

- Inputs:

### WOTS+C

WOTS+C was designed as an improvement to WOTS-TW[^sphincs+c].
It is superior in compactness & performance, but we nonetheless use WOTS-TW for the stateless path to retain compatibility with SLH-DSA[^slhdsa], while WOTS+C is used in the custom stateful component of SHRINCS to reduce signature size.

WOTS+C replaces the checksum in WOTS-TW with a protocol requirement that any message must be mapped to a set of indexes that sum to a fixed constant.
This prevents WOTS forgeries because an incremental increase in any index of a hash chain must be balanced out by decrementing a different index.
It also ensures a fixed-work verifier because the total number of hash operations needed to complete every WOTS hash chain is fixed.

The constant-sum parameter `WOTS_C_CONSTANT_SUM` is chosen to maximize the probability that a randomly selected set of indexes will sum to this value.
It can be computed by:

```py
WOTS_C_CONSTANT_SUM = ceildiv(WOTS_C_CHAIN_COUNT * (2**WOTS_C_CHAIN_BITS - 1), 2)
```

Only a subset of index-sets have this "constant-sum" property - for the chosen parameters, about 2<sup>122</sup> out of the possible 2<sup>128</sup> sets of indexes.  <!-- TODO: template these numbers -->
To map a given message onto this subset, the signer must _grind_ a hash function applied to the message and a rolling integer counter.
The hash function ensures the surjective mapping of messages to index-sets is one-way and distributed randomly.
If the mapping were not one-way, an attacker could work backwards to find other messages valid under the same signature.

Eventually the signer finds a counter which maps the message to a set of indexes that sum to `WOTS_C_CONSTANT_SUM`.
This counter is appended to the WOTS+C signature.
The verifier rejects counters which don't map the message to a constant-sum index-set.


#### `wots_c_grind_to_constant_sum(...)`

<!-- DOC START wots_c_grind_to_constant_sum -->
The WOTS+C grinding function. Grinds up to 2^16 counters until one maps `message_digest` to a
constant-sum index set, returning the lowest such counter and its index set.

- Inputs:
  - `pk_seed`: a 16-byte public seed.
  - `message_digest`: a 32-byte intermediate message digest (from `H_msg_sf`).
  - `ADRS`: a 22-byte address.
- Outputs:
  - the smallest valid grinding `counter`: a 16-bit unsigned integer.
  - the constant-sum set of hash chain indexes it yields: `WOTS_C_CHAIN_COUNT` `WOTS_C_CHAIN_BITS`-bit unsigned integers.
  - or null, in place of both.

This function is only used in the stateful path, and only by the signer.

```py
def wots_c_grind_to_constant_sum(
    pk_seed: Bytes[16], message_digest: Bytes[32], ADRS: bytearray
) -> Optional[tuple[UInt16, Array[UInt16, WOTS_C_CHAIN_COUNT]]]:
  ADRS[9] = SF_WOTS_C_GRIND
  for i in range(2**16):
    hashed = H_grind(pk_seed, ADRS, message_digest, i)
    indexes = base_2b(hashed, WOTS_C_CHAIN_BITS, WOTS_C_CHAIN_COUNT)
    if sum(indexes) == WOTS_C_CONSTANT_SUM:
      return (i, indexes)

  return None # practically impossible
```
<!-- DOC END wots_c_grind_to_constant_sum -->

We max out at 2<sup>16</sup> grinding attempts because the counter is serialized as a 16-bit unsigned integer in the WOTS+C signature encoding - Counters larger than this would not fit into a signature.
There is technically a chance that the signer may exhaust all of these attempts without finding a valid counter; however, we have engineered our parameter set such that this probability is less than 1 chance in 2<sup><!-- CONST START WOTS_C_GRIND_FAIL_PROBABILITY_LOG -->1450<!-- CONST END WOTS_C_GRIND_FAIL_PROBABILITY_LOG --></sup>[^wotsgrind] - practically impossible.

### XMSS

The _eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme_ (XMSS) is a stateful hash-based signature scheme which can produce signatures on up to a fixed number of messages.

Conceptually, an XMSS keypair is a merkle tree whose leaves are one-time signature (OTS) keypairs.
The XMSS public key is the root hash of the merkle tree.
An XMSS signature is an OTS signature alongside a merkle tree authentication proof which links the OTS public key to the merkle root hash.
The verifier recomputes the OTS public key, and follows the merkle proof to recompute the XMSS public key.

In SHRINCS, we instantiate XMSS twice, to be used differently in both stateful and stateless components of a SHRINCS keypair.

```
      XMSS (balanced)                  |             FXMSS (flexible)
                                       |
           root                        |                 root
       ___/    \___                    |                /    \
      O            O                   |               O      L
     / \          / \                  |              / \
    O   O        O   O                 |             L   O
   / \ / \      / \ / \                |                / \
  L  L L  L    L  L L  L               |               L   L

                O = inner Merkle node    L = WOTS leaf (OTS keypair)
```

Both schemes are Merkle trees whose leaves are OTS keypairs and whose root is the public key.
Their tree structures differ: XMSS (stateless path) is always a perfectly balanced tree of fixed height, while FXMSS (stateful path) admits flexible structures, with WOTS+C leaves placed at varying depths.

- In the stateless component, traditional balanced XMSS is used with WOTS-TW as the leaf OTS scheme to certify child layers of the SLH-DSA hypertree, and to certify FORS public keys.
- In the stateful component, Flexible XMSS (FXMSS) is used with WOTS+C to sign messages directly.

In XMSS (stateless path), merkle trees are always perfectly balanced, and always have a fixed height `SPHX_XMSS_HEIGHT`.
This matches the XMSS tree structure specified in FIPS-205.

In FXMSS (stateful path), merkle trees can be balanced or unbalanced, and the WOTS+C leaf keys may be placed up to `FXMSS_HEIGHT` layers deep.
This permits more flexible constructions.

Notably for security, XMSS is always used as part of the SPHINCS (SLH-DSA) framework to sign trusted messages generated by the signer, while FXMSS is used as a standalone scheme and so may sign untrusted messages.
This means the interfaces of both XMSS and FXMSS are slightly different, and this is a crucial security requirement.

>[!note]
> ### On Merkle Tree Positions
>
> Every node in an XMSS or FXMSS merkle tree is identified by a pair of coordinates: a _height_ and an _index_.
>
> The index counts nodes from the left within a layer, starting at zero.
> The node at height `h` and index `i` has child nodes at indexes `2*i` (left) and `2*i + 1` (right) at height `h - 1`.
> Conversely, the ancestor of that node `j` layers above it has index `i >> j`, and the sibling of that ancestor has index `(i >> j) ^ 1`.
>
> More specifically for the different merkle tree constructions of XMSS, FXMSS, and FORS:
>
> - In XMSS, the WOTS-TW leaves sit at height 0, and the root sits at height `SPHX_XMSS_HEIGHT`.
>   All leaves share a common layer.
> - In FXMSS, the WOTS+C leaves can sit at any height, and the root always sits at height `FXMSS_HEIGHT`.
>   We often refer to a node's depth as its distance below the root: `depth = FXMSS_HEIGHT - height`.
>   Because WOTS+C leaves may be placed at different depths, there is no common leaf layer.
>   A leaf sits at height 0 only at the maximum depth of 255.
>   In this sense `FXMSS_HEIGHT` is an "imaginary" height because no real FXMSS tree can fully explore the enormous possible space of 2<sup>256</sup> nodes.
> - In FORS, the preimage leaves sit at height 0, and the root of each of the merkle trees in the forest is at height `SPHX_FORS_HEIGHT`.
>   All leaves share a common layer, but internally FORS tree node indexes count across the entire forest, and so the indexing scheme is more subtle.
>   A node at index `i` in the `j`-th FORS tree at height `h` actually has a forest-wide index of `j * 2**(SPHX_FORS_HEIGHT - h) + i`, which is filled in the `tree_index` field in `ADRS` under the `SL_FORS_TREE` type.
>   In other words, the index of a FORS node or leaf must account for all the other nodes to its left at the same height in the other FORS trees.
>
> When merkle nodes are combined with the hash function `H`, the coordinates written into the `ADRS` are those of the node being computed (the parent), not of its children.
> In XMSS, the tree height field of an `SL_XMSS_TREE` address therefore only takes values 1 through `SPHX_XMSS_HEIGHT` - Leaf nodes are not addressed by tree coordinates at all, but through the WOTS-TW keypair index, which equals the leaf's index at height 0.
> In FXMSS (stateful path), a WOTS+C leaf's coordinates are carried in the `node_height` and `node_index` fields of `ADRS`.

Unlike a directionless merkle tree, XMSS requires explicit left/right direction in the structure of its merkle tree for security.[^xmss-directional]

### Hypertree Signing

The SHRINCS stateless path utilizes the design strategy of a _hypertree,_ first introduced by the original SPHINCS paper[^sphincs].
A hypertree is a tree of XMSS trees arranged into _layers_, where each OTS leaf signs the root hash of a child XMSS tree on the next layer down to certify the child tree's authenticity.
Every child tree is thus verifiably connected to the root tree, in a similar fashion to TLS certificate chains.
Each tree has `2**SPHX_XMSS_HEIGHT` such certified children.

Because each XMSS tree is generated deterministically from a seed, the signer does not need to worry about OTS key reuse when certifying child XMSS trees, and so she can avoid caching every XMSS tree in the hypertree.
The signer can _just-in-time_ generate the XMSS trees that will be used for a specific signature, and thereafter those trees can be discarded from memory.
This diagram shows a simplified example with three layers of XMSS trees with height 2.

<img src="img/hypertree.svg">

A hypertree signature is simply a chain of `SPHX_LAYER_COUNT` XMSS signatures, starting from the bottom-layer which signs a given 16-byte message.

<img src="img/hypertree-signature.svg">

The following algorithms are used only for stateless hypertree signing and verification.

#### `hypertree_sign(...)`

### FXMSS

FXMSS is the stateful signature component used by SHRINCS.
An FXMSS signer selects a tree structure at key generation, subject to the addressing constraints described below.[^fxmss_node_index]
The tree structure determines which positions in the FXMSS tree contain WOTS+C public keys.

The FXMSS verifier is agnostic to the positions of WOTS+C public keys other than the one used for the signature.
It recomputes the FXMSS root from the WOTS+C signature, the position of the corresponding public key, and the Merkle authentication path.
This allows signers to select their FXMSS tree structure at key generation without changing the verifier.

Because of this flexibility, it is necessary for signers to remember what structure of FXMSS tree they created at key generation time.
To encourage interoperability, we define an encoding for FXMSS tree structures which will be stored in the SHRINCS signer's serialized secret key as two additional bytes.

A _tree structure_ for FXMSS is encoded as a tuple of two numbers: ***shape*** and ***depth***.

- ***Shape*** is a flag byte that defines which FXMSS nodes are to be WOTS+C leaves.
  We will describe two recommended tree shapes below.
- ***Depth*** is an 8-bit unsigned integer describing the height of the FXMSS tree, or more precisely, the distance from the root node to the deepest leaf node.

These two parameters define the FXMSS _tree structure_.

The shape and depth bytes will be encoded in the serialized SHRINCS secret key so that implementations which import the key have a clear directive for how to build the same FXMSS tree in the SHRINCS stateful path.
Implementations which import SHRINCS keys MUST respect the shape and depth bytes to reproduce the stateful tree and issue valid stateful signatures.


#### Tree Shapes

This specification prescribes two FXMSS tree shapes: **Unbalanced XMSS (UXMSS)** and **Balanced XMSS (BXMSS)**.
Both shapes use the same FXMSS verifier.
They differ in how WOTS+C public keys are placed in the tree and selected for signing.

The two shapes are identified by their respective constants.

| Shape Flag | Value | Description |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| `FXMSS_SHAPE_UNBALANCED` | 0 | Indicates UXMSS, with a left-leaning unbalanced tree. |
| `FXMSS_SHAPE_BALANCED` | 1 | Indicates BXMSS, with a balanced tree of specific depth. |
| ... | 2...255 | Reserved. |

We leave open the possibility to define new shape flags for new XMSS tree structures, but we encourage signers to utilize the recommended shapes wherever possible, for the sake of security and anonymity.

The following sections describe the usage properties of the two shapes, and we let the variable `depth` represent the depth byte as a parameter of the shape.


##### `FXMSS_SHAPE_UNBALANCED`

When the shape byte is set to `FXMSS_SHAPE_UNBALANCED`, signers use an unbalanced, left-leaning XMSS tree of height `depth`.

```
                   root
                  /    \
                 O    leaf
               /   \
              O   leaf
            /   \
           O   leaf
         /   \
       ...  leaf
       /
      O
    /   \
 leaf   leaf
```

This FXMSS tree shape allows signers to generate very short stateful signatures for the first few signatures, since the signer can use the shallowest WOTS+C leaves right away, and these have very short merkle authentication paths.

However, since each WOTS+C leaf can be used only once, subsequent signatures will grow larger at a rate of 16 or 17 bytes per signature issued as the merkle authentication path grows in length, with the exception of the last signature which has the same length as the penultimate one.[^last_two_sigs]

Eventually, after `depth + 1` signatures, the UXMSS stateful path will be exhausted and unusable, and the last few stateful signatures will be very large.

For most use cases, unless compute power is very limited, we recommend setting `depth = FXMSS_HEIGHT` for UXMSS (the maximum), as even a WOTS+C leaf at maximum depth will still produce a shorter signature than the stateless path.
FXMSS depth cannot exceed `FXMSS_HEIGHT = 255` because the FXMSS node height number is encoded into the signature and `ADRS` as a single byte.

##### `FXMSS_SHAPE_BALANCED`

When the shape byte is set to `FXMSS_SHAPE_BALANCED`, signers use a balanced binary XMSS tree, of height `depth`.

```
                  root
              /          \
           /                \
         O                    O
       /   \                /   \
     ...   ...            ...   ...
     /       \            /       \
    O         O          O         O
  /   \     /   \      /   \     /   \
leaf leaf leaf leaf  leaf leaf leaf leaf
```

This FXMSS tree shape allows signers to generate a larger quantity of stateful signatures.
Unlike UXMSS, stateful SHRINCS signatures using a BXMSS tree will have a consistent size, up until the stateful path is exhausted, because all WOTS+C leaves will use the same merkle authentication path length.

The `depth` of the BXMSS tree at key generation time has a significant impact on the performance of the SHRINCS stateful signing path.
The exact size of the constant-size signatures is also dictated by `depth`: each step further from the root node we take, we must add 16 bytes to the FXMSS signature.
Furthermore, each step doubles the number of leaf nodes, and so doubles the signature budget, but also doubles the amount of computational work needed for BXMSS key generation and/or signing.

Signer implementations may specify any height for BXMSS trees depending on their use-cases, but typical safe defaults range from `depth = 8` (256 signatures, matching the budget of UXMSS) to `depth = 20` (1 million signatures), or more in special circumstances.


##### Custom Shapes

Signers _may_ design custom shapes,[^fxmss_node_index] as the verifier is agnostic to the shape of the signer's FXMSS tree.

This specification only defines two shapes: BXMSS and UXMSS. For security and privacy we highly recommend signers stick to the two prescribed shapes.


##### Caveats

- Only nodes with index less than `2**64` are indexable in FXMSS.[^fxmss_node_index]
- Some tree structures are invalid or impractical to generate, such as a balanced tree of height 255.
- A tree of depth 0 has no stateful signatures, whatever its shape.
  Its root is the only position a WOTS+C leaf could occupy, and a signature made there carries no authentication path, so it falls below `FXMSS_SIGNATURE_SIZE_MIN` and every verifier rejects it.
  Signers MUST NOT issue a stateful signature under a depth-zero key; every state counter falls back to the stateless path.
  The signature counts given for each shape above therefore apply only from depth 1 upwards.
- Implementations must take care when using SHRINCS secret keys imported from untrusted sources, especially if depending on shape and depth bytes for security-critical logic.

These algorithms are used only for the stateful FXMSS sub-scheme.

### FORS

The stateless signing path of SHRINCS uses Forest Of Random Subsets (FORS), a hash-based _few-time_ signature scheme (FTS), to sign messages.

Compared to one-time signature (OTS) schemes like Winternitz, FTS schemes are characterized by security which resists forgery even when a keypair is reused to sign multiple messages.
The degradation in security can be quantified and calibrated using parameters, so that forgery-resistance does not fall below a target bound.
FORS is one such FTS scheme.


#### Informal Description

Here follows an informal description of the FORS FTS scheme as it is defined in FIPS-205.[^slhdsa]

A FORS keypair consists of a _forest_ of merkle trees of a fixed size, where each leaf is a hash of a preimage derived by a PRF.
We parameterize the number of merkle trees as `SPHX_FORS_COUNT`, and the height of each tree as `SPHX_FORS_HEIGHT`.
The FORS public key is a hash of the merkle roots of the entire forest.

When signing, a message and randomizer `R` are mapped via a hash to a set of `SPHX_FORS_COUNT` integer indexes, of `SPHX_FORS_HEIGHT` bits each.
Each index identifies a specific preimage from each merkle tree which the signer must reveal, along with a merkle authentication path.
The verifier uses the preimages and merkle paths to recompute the roots of each tree, and finally recomputes the FORS public key to verify the signature.

<img src="img/fors.svg">

<sup>This diagram illustrates a toy FORS keypair, with merkle trees of height 2. Messages are mapped to a set of `k` 2-bit integers which select an index from each tree.</sup>

Each signature reveals one of the preimages in each merkle tree in the forest.
Over the course of many signatures, the signer may reuse preimages that have already been revealed in prior signatures, because some messages may map to intersecting index-sets.

Unless he has an efficient way to find preimages, an adversary must hope the signer publishes signatures that admit a forgery by mixing and matching preimages from prior signatures.
The adversary _cannot_ control which index-sets the victim signs, and so he cannot trick the signer into exposing specific preimages, even if the adversary can query the signer for arbitrary signatures.

However, the adversary _may_ grind to find a message-randomizer pair which maps to an index-set that is a _subset_ of the index-sets signed previously, which would admit a forgery.
The probability that this occurs with a randomly sampled index-set can be made arbitrarily low by using more and taller trees, or by reducing the limit on the number of signatures the signer is expected to produce.
This is formalized as the security notion of _interleaved target-subset resilience._[^sphincs+]


### FORS Algorithms

The following sections describe the algorithms needed for FORS key-generation, signing, and verification.


#### `fors_sk_gen(...)`

<!-- DOC START fors_sk_gen -->
The FORS secret preimage generation function. Generates the secret 16-byte preimage of the FORS
leaf at forest-wide index `node_index`. The `ADRS` must be prefilled with the location of the FORS
keypair to ensure the hashes are properly tweaked.

- Inputs:
  - `sk_seed`: a 16-byte secret.
  - `pk_seed`: a 16-byte public seed.
  - `ADRS`: a 22-byte address.
  - `node_index`: a 32-bit unsigned integer, a forest-wide leaf index in `[0, SPHX_FORS_COUNT * 2**SPHX_FORS_HEIGHT)`.
- Output:
  - a 16-byte preimage.

This function is only used in the stateless path, and only by the signer.

Note the `node_index` of a FORS leaf or node is _indexed across the entire forest,_ not just
within a single tree. The index of leaf `l` in tree `t` is `t * 2**SPHX_FORS_HEIGHT + l`.

```py
def fors_sk_gen(
    sk_seed: Bytes[16], pk_seed: Bytes[16], ADRS: bytearray, node_index: UInt32

```
<!-- DOC END fors_sk_gen -->


#### `fors_node(...)`

<!-- DOC START fors_node -->
The FORS internal node computation function. Recursively computes the FORS node at the forest-wide

to ensure the hashes are properly tweaked.

- Inputs:
  - `sk_seed`: a 16-byte secret.
  - `node_index`: a 32-bit unsigned integer, a forest-wide node index in
    `[0, SPHX_FORS_COUNT * 2**(SPHX_FORS_HEIGHT - node_height))`.
  - `node_height`: a 32-bit unsigned integer, a node height in `[0, SPHX_FORS_HEIGHT]`.
  - `pk_seed`: a 16-byte public seed.
  - `ADRS`: a 22-byte address.
- Output:
  - a 16-byte FORS node hash.

This function is only used in the stateless path, and only by the signer.

Note the `node_index` of a FORS leaf or node is _indexed across the entire forest,_ not just
within a single tree. The index of node `l` in tree `t` at height `h` is
`t * 2**(SPHX_FORS_HEIGHT - h) + l`.

#### `fors_pubkey_from_sig(...)`

<!-- DOC START fors_pubkey_from_sig -->
The FORS verification function. Recovers a FORS public key from a `signature` on a

### SLH-DSA

The stateless signing path of SHRINCS uses the _StateLess Hash-based Digital Signature Algorithm_ (SLH-DSA) defined in FIPS-205[^slhdsa] with a non-standard parameter set.

SLH-DSA is built out of the WOTS-TW, XMSS, and FORS subschemes already defined earlier in this document.
In SLH-DSA, the signer uses a hypertree of XMSS trees to sign one of many possible FORS keypairs, which then signs the actual message.
The addition of FORS makes SLH-DSA secure against a limited degree of leaf reuse, allowing us to discard state-management requirements.

By hashing a _randomizer_ with the message, the signer randomly selects the exact position of the FORS keypair used to sign the message, in a way the verifier can reproduce.
This ensures an adversary querying the signer for signatures cannot control which FORS keypair a signer will use, nor can they predictably control which FORS keypair to use for a forgery.
The randomizer is sampled pseudorandomly by the signer, using the `PRF_msg_sl` hash function.

The signer uses the selected FORS keypair to sign the message, and then certifies the FORS public key using a hypertree signature.
The final SLH-DSA signature consists of:

- A 16-byte _randomizer_
- A FORS signature on a message
- A hypertree signature on the FORS public key

<img src="img/slh-dsa-signature.svg">

The following sections describe the algorithms used for SLH-DSA.


#### `slh_dsa_digest_message(...)`

<!-- DOC START slh_dsa_digest_message -->
The SLH-DSA message hashing function. Derives the FORS message digest, bottom-layer XMSS tree
index, and FORS keypair index from `message` under `H_msg_sl`.

- Inputs:
  - `R`: a 16-byte randomizer.
  - `pk_seed`: a 16-byte public seed.
  - `sl_root`: the 16-byte root hash of the stateless root tree.
  - `message`: a variable-length message.
- Outputs:
  - a `FORS_DIGEST_SIZE`-byte message digest, ready for use by FORS.
  - a 64-bit unsigned integer, a pseudorandomly selected index of a bottom-layer XMSS tree,
    in `[0, 2**SPHX_TREE_INDEX_BITS)`.
  - a 32-bit unsigned integer, a pseudorandomly selected index of a FORS key within an XMSS
    tree, in `[0, 2**SPHX_XMSS_HEIGHT)`.

This function is only used in the stateless path, and by both the signer and the verifier.

```py
def slh_dsa_digest_message(
    R: Bytes[16], pk_seed: Bytes[16], sl_root: Bytes[16], message: bytes
) -> tuple[Bytes[FORS_DIGEST_SIZE], UInt64, UInt32]:
  digest = H_msg_sl(R, pk_seed, sl_root, message)

  fors_digest = digest[:FORS_DIGEST_SIZE]
  offset = FORS_DIGEST_SIZE

  tree_index_digest = digest[offset : offset + ceildiv(SPHX_TREE_INDEX_BITS, 8)]
  offset += len(tree_index_digest)

  leaf_index_digest = digest[offset : offset + ceildiv(SPHX_XMSS_HEIGHT, 8)]

  tree_index = int.from_bytes(tree_index_digest) % (2**(SPHX_XMSS_HEIGHT * (SPHX_LAYER_COUNT - 1)))
  leaf_index = int.from_bytes(leaf_index_digest) % (2**SPHX_XMSS_HEIGHT)
  return (fors_digest, tree_index, leaf_index)
```
<!-- DOC END slh_dsa_digest_message -->


#### `slh_dsa_sign(...)`

<!-- DOC START slh_dsa_sign -->
The SLH-DSA signing function. Signs `message` with `sk_seed`, prepending the context `ctx`;
uses `pk_seed` as the public seed, derives the randomizer from `sk_prf`/`opt_rand`, and binds the
signature to `sl_root`. Verifiers must use `slh_dsa_verify` with the same `ctx`.

When provided, `opt_rand` supplies the additional randomness used to derive the randomizer. If omitted,
the algorithm uses `pk_seed` in its place, resulting in the _deterministic variant_ of SLH-DSA.

The resulting signature is composed of (1) a randomizer, (2) a FORS signature, and (3) a
hypertree signature, all concatenated together.

- Inputs:
  - `message`: a variable-length message.
  - `ctx`: a context of at most 255 bytes.
  - `sk_seed`: a 16-byte secret.
  - `sk_prf`: a 16-byte secret.
  - `pk_seed`: a 16-byte public seed.
  - `sl_root`: the 16-byte root hash of the stateless root tree.
  - `opt_rand`: optional 16-byte additional randomness.
- Output:
  - a `SPHX_SIGNATURE_SIZE`-byte signature.

This function is only used in the stateless path, and only by the signer.

```py
def slh_dsa_sign(
    message: bytes,
    ctx: Bytes[:255],
    sk_seed: Bytes[16],
    sk_prf: Bytes[16],
    pk_seed: Bytes[16],
    sl_root: Bytes[16],
    opt_rand: Optional[Bytes[16]],
) -> Bytes[SPHX_SIGNATURE_SIZE]:
  assert len(ctx) < 256
  contextualized_msg = (0).to_bytes(1) + len(ctx).to_bytes(1) + ctx + message

  if opt_rand is None:
    opt_rand = pk_seed # deterministic mode

  R = PRF_msg_sl(sk_prf, opt_rand, contextualized_msg)
  fors_digest, tree_index, leaf_index = slh_dsa_digest_message(R, pk_seed, sl_root, contextualized_msg)

  ADRS = bytearray(22)
  ADRS[1:9] = tree_index.to_bytes(8)
  ADRS[10:14] = leaf_index.to_bytes(4)

  fors_signature = fors_sign(fors_digest, sk_seed, pk_seed, ADRS)
  fors_pubkey = fors_pubkey_from_sig(fors_signature, fors_digest, pk_seed, ADRS)
  hypertree_signature = hypertree_sign(fors_pubkey, sk_seed, pk_seed, tree_index, leaf_index)

  return R + fors_signature + hypertree_signature
```
<!-- DOC END slh_dsa_sign -->


#### `slh_dsa_verify(...)`

<!-- DOC START slh_dsa_verify -->
The SLH-DSA verification function. Recovers the root-tree root from a `signature` on `message`
(with context `ctx`) and checks it against `sl_root`. Signatures must be produced via
`slh_dsa_sign` with the same `ctx`.

- Inputs:
  - `message`: a variable-length message.
  - `signature`: a candidate signature, of any length. Any length other than
    `SPHX_SIGNATURE_SIZE` is not a signature, and is rejected.
  - `ctx`: a context of at most 255 bytes.
  - `pk_seed`: a 16-byte public seed.
  - `sl_root`: the 16-byte root hash of the stateless root tree.
- Output:
  - a boolean indicating if the signature is valid.

This function is only used in the stateless path, and only by the verifier.

```py
def slh_dsa_verify(
    message: bytes,
    signature: bytes,
    ctx: Bytes[:255],
    pk_seed: Bytes[16],
    sl_root: Bytes[16],
) -> bool:
  assert len(ctx) < 256
  contextualized_msg = (0).to_bytes(1) + len(ctx).to_bytes(1) + ctx + message

  if len(signature) != SPHX_SIGNATURE_SIZE:
    return False

  R = signature[0:16]
  fors_signature = signature[16 : 16 + FORS_SIGNATURE_SIZE]
  hypertree_signature = signature[16 + FORS_SIGNATURE_SIZE : SPHX_SIGNATURE_SIZE]

  fors_digest, tree_index, leaf_index = slh_dsa_digest_message(R, pk_seed, sl_root, contextualized_msg)

  ADRS = bytearray(22)
  ADRS[1:9] = tree_index.to_bytes(8)
  ADRS[10:14] = leaf_index.to_bytes(4)

  fors_pubkey = fors_pubkey_from_sig(fors_signature, fors_digest, pk_seed, ADRS)
  return hypertree_verify(fors_pubkey, hypertree_signature, pk_seed, tree_index, leaf_index, sl_root)
```
<!-- DOC END slh_dsa_verify -->

### SHRINCS

Above we have defined all the prerequisite building blocks of the SHRINCS scheme, and we are ready to define the high-level stateful and stateless key-generation, signing, and verification algorithms of SHRINCS.

As described earlier in the [overview](#overview), SHRINCS combines FXMSS (stateful) and SLH-DSA (stateless) into a single unified signature scheme.
The stateful path admits very compact and efficient signatures, while the stateless path allows signers to retain signing capability even if state has been lost or corrupted.

#### SHRINCS Keys

A SHRINCS key pair starts its life at key-generation, which the caller seeds with 48 random bytes.
These 48 random bytes are partitioned into 3 x 16-byte chunks: `sk_seed`, `sk_prf`, and `pk_seed`.

From `sk_seed` and `pk_seed`, the key-generation procedure derives the roots of two merkle trees: `sl_root` and `sf_root`.
These represent the stateless and stateful keypairs respectively.
No additional parameters are needed to derive `sl_root`, but to derive `sf_root` the caller needs to know which `sf_structure` to apply in FXMSS (see [the section on FXMSS](#fxmss) for more details).

Once both roots are generated, the caller combines them with `pk_seed` to form the SHRINCS public key:

```py
shrincs_pubkey = pk_seed + sl_root + sf_root
```

This encoding is chosen such that slicing off the last 16 bytes (`sf_root`) yields the public key produced by the SLH-DSA key-generation algorithm with the non-standard parameter set used by the stateless component.

The SHRINCS secret key is encoded as:

```py
shrincs_seckey = sk_seed + sk_prf + pk_seed + sl_root + sf_structure + sf_root
```

This encoding is chosen such that slicing off the last 18 bytes (`sf_structure + sf_root`) yields a valid secret key for the stateless component.

<img src="./img/shrincs-keys.svg">

#### Contexts

The high-level `shrincs_sign` and `shrincs_verify` functions accept a context parameter `ctx`, which restricts signature validity to within a specific use-case, protocol, or other such zone of specificity.
Signatures created by `shrincs_sign` when given a certain `ctx` are invalid if verified using `shrincs_verify` with any other context value.
Typically `ctx` is set to some hard-coded constant value, to prevent misuse.
For example, if a signer creates a signature with `ctx = b"bitcoin-tx"`, this signature cannot be replayed with `ctx = b"auth-challenge"`.

This mirrors the interface of SLH-DSA[^slhdsa], and in fact the stateless signing component passes `ctx` transparently through to the `slh_dsa_sign` and `slh_dsa_verify` functions.

#### On Managing State

A SHRINCS secret key needs its accompanying state to use the high-efficiency stateful signing component.
Every SHRINCS key has a fixed number of stateful signature slots which allow the signer to use compact WOTS+C signatures via the FXMSS (stateful) signing path.
As previously discussed in [the section on WOTS](#wots-schemes), reusing a one-time signature keypair within FXMSS to sign distinct messages will break the security of the scheme and permit forgeries.
To avoid using the same WOTS+C keypair more than once, signers using FXMSS must track a single integer, called the _state counter._
This counter tracks the number of signatures previously issued by the keypair.
It increments once for every stateful FXMSS signature created, and _must never decrement._
When signing, the SHRINCS stateful signing algorithm chooses which WOTS+C leaf to use based on the state counter and the FXMSS tree structure.

It is **absolutely critical for security that signers manage state counters extremely carefully.**
Implementors must take care to avoid many dangerous state management practices which lead to state reuse:

- State counters must not be backed up and restored by any mechanism.
- State counters must not live in unprotected storage (e.g. shared memory, a user-accessible folder, etc).
- State counters must not be exported and imported into other software.
- Implementations must not allow concurrent signing.
- Signers must increment the state counter in persistent storage _before_ returning an FXMSS signature to the caller.

Signers are highly encouraged to store state counters only in durable, persistent, rollback-resistant storage which is protected against unauthorized modification.

If correct state is not available for any reason, such as when restoring from a static backup, then a SHRINCS implementation MUST refuse to sign with the stateful path, and utilize only the stateless signing path.

#### Maximum Message Length

Every message SHRINCS hashes is bounded in length, because it is ultimately absorbed by SHA-256, which accepts at most `2**61 - 1` bytes.
`shrincs_sign` and `shrincs_verify` cap `message` at `2**61 - 384` bytes.
This cap is set by the longest prefix a message can sit behind.
On the stateless path it reaches the innermost hash behind `98` bytes of fixed prefixes (the 64-byte HMAC block, the 16-byte `opt_rand`, the 2-byte SLH-DSA message prefix, and the 16-byte `sf_root`); on the stateful path, behind `107` (the 64-byte HMAC block, the 16-byte `pk_seed`, the 9-byte leaf position, the 2-byte binding prefix, and the 16-byte `sl_root`), which is the longer of the two.
The caller's `ctx` is prepended on either path, adding up to a further 255 bytes, so the longest prefix any message sits behind is `362`.
SHA-256's limit then gives an exact maximum of `2**61 - 363` bytes, which we round down to `2**61 - 384`, the largest multiple of SHA-256's 64-byte block size that stays within this limit.
The intermediate functions accept *a variable-length message*.
Its length still carries an upper bound, just an implicit one, set by the primitive bounds above rather than stated at each function: a SHRINCS `message` is already capped, and each intermediate prepends at most a known number of bytes to it, so every hash input stays within SHA-256's limit by construction. No realistic message will ever approach this cap.

#### SHRINCS Algorithms

The following sections describe algorithms used for SHRINCS.


#### `shrincs_keygen(...)`

<!-- DOC START shrincs_keygen -->
The SHRINCS key generation function. Computes the secret and public keys from a 48-byte `seed`
and the stateful tree `sf_structure`.

- Inputs:
  - `seed`: a 48-byte random seed. Must be sampled from a CSRNG.
  - `sf_structure`: a 2-byte identifier describing the FXMSS tree structure: a shape byte, which
    must be one of the `FXMSS_SHAPE_*` values, followed by a depth byte. See the recommended
    depths for each shape in [Tree Shapes](#tree-shapes).
- Outputs:
  - an 82-byte SHRINCS secret key.
  - a 48-byte SHRINCS public key.

This function is used only during key generation.

> [!WARNING]
> The `sf_structure` argument, consisting of a shape byte followed by a depth byte `d`, must come
> from a trusted source or else be validated. If an adversary can control it, they may cause
> key-generation to fail, or hang consuming compute resources. Computing the root of a balanced tree
> of depth `d` requires `2**d` WOTS+C public-key generations, so implementations should reject a
> depth they cannot afford to compute.

```py
def shrincs_keygen(seed: Bytes[48], sf_structure: Bytes[2]) -> tuple[Bytes[82], Bytes[48]]:
  assert len(seed) == 48
  assert len(sf_structure) == 2
  assert sf_structure[0] == FXMSS_SHAPE_UNBALANCED or sf_structure[0] == FXMSS_SHAPE_BALANCED

  sk_seed = seed[0:16]
  sk_prf  = seed[16:32]
  pk_seed = seed[32:48]

  ADRS = bytearray(22)
  ADRS[0] = SPHX_LAYER_COUNT - 1
  sl_root = xmss_node(sk_seed, 0, SPHX_XMSS_HEIGHT, pk_seed, ADRS)
  tree_balanced = sf_structure[0] == FXMSS_SHAPE_BALANCED
  sf_root = fxmss_node(sk_seed, 0, FXMSS_HEIGHT, pk_seed, tree_balanced, sf_structure[1], bytearray(22))

  shrincs_seckey = sk_seed + sk_prf + pk_seed + sl_root + sf_structure + sf_root
  shrincs_pubkey = pk_seed + sl_root + sf_root
  return (shrincs_seckey, shrincs_pubkey)
```
<!-- DOC END shrincs_keygen -->


#### `shrincs_sf_leaf_select(...)`

<!-- DOC START shrincs_sf_leaf_select -->
The SHRINCS stateful-path leaf-selection function. Computes the position `(index, height)` of the
next WOTS+C leaf for the given `sf_structure` and `state_ctr`.

- Inputs:
  - `sf_structure`: a 2-byte identifier describing the FXMSS tree structure.
  - `state_ctr`: a 64-bit unsigned integer, the number of stateful signatures the keypair has
    previously issued, or `None`.
- Outputs:
  - a 64-bit unsigned integer, the left-to-right index of the next WOTS+C leaf in the FXMSS tree.
  - an 8-bit unsigned integer, the bottom-to-top height of the next WOTS+C leaf in the FXMSS tree.

Returns `None` if `state_ctr` is `None`, or if it is at least the number of WOTS+C leaves in the
FXMSS tree (as defined by its structure). A depth-zero tree has no usable leaf, so a depth-zero
key signs only on the stateless path.

This function is only used in the stateful path, and only by the signer.

```py
def shrincs_sf_leaf_select(
    sf_structure: Bytes[2], state_ctr: Optional[UInt64]
) -> Optional[tuple[UInt64, UInt8]]:
  if state_ctr is None:
    return None

  tree_shape, tree_depth = sf_structure[0], sf_structure[1]

  # A depth-zero tree holds no usable WOTS+C leaf.
  if tree_depth == 0:
    return None

  if tree_shape == FXMSS_SHAPE_UNBALANCED:
    if state_ctr == tree_depth:
      return (0, FXMSS_HEIGHT - tree_depth)
    if state_ctr < tree_depth:
      return (1, FXMSS_HEIGHT - 1 - state_ctr)

  elif tree_shape == FXMSS_SHAPE_BALANCED:
    if state_ctr < 2**tree_depth:
      return (state_ctr, FXMSS_HEIGHT - tree_depth)

  # - unknown FXMSS tree shape
  # - no more signatures left
  return None
```
<!-- DOC END shrincs_sf_leaf_select -->


#### `shrincs_sign(...)`

<!-- DOC START shrincs_sign -->
The SHRINCS signing function. Signs `message` and `ctx` with the serialized secret key `shrincs_seckey`:
uses the stateful FXMSS path when `state_ctr` is valid for the key's tree structure, otherwise
falls back to the stateless SLH-DSA path. Verifiers must use `shrincs_verify` with the same `ctx`.

- Inputs:
  - `message`: a message of at most `2**61 - 384` bytes.
  - `ctx`: a context of at most 255 bytes.
  - `shrincs_seckey`: an 82-byte SHRINCS secret key.
  - `state_ctr`: a 64-bit unsigned integer, the number of stateful signatures the keypair has
    previously issued, or `None` to sign statelessly.
  - `opt_rand`: optional 16-byte additional randomness for SLH-DSA (unused in the stateful path;
    if omitted, the stateless path uses the deterministic variant of SLH-DSA).
- Output:
  - a `SHRINCS_SL_SIGNATURE_SIZE`-byte stateless signature, or a stateful signature of at least
    `SHRINCS_SF_SIGNATURE_SIZE_MIN` bytes and at most `SHRINCS_SF_SIGNATURE_SIZE_MAX` bytes,
    or null.

This function is used only by the signer.

> [!WARNING]
> The two-byte FXMSS tree structure encoded in `shrincs_seckey`, consisting of a shape byte followed
> by a depth byte `d`, must come from a trusted source or else be validated. If an adversary can

#### `shrincs_verify(...)`

<!-- DOC START shrincs_verify -->
The SHRINCS verification function. Returns true iff `signature` is a valid stateful or stateless
SHRINCS signature on `message` under `shrincs_pubkey`. Signatures must be produced via
`shrincs_sign` with the same `ctx`.

The first byte of `signature` is called the _indicator byte_ and it tells the verifier which signing
component to use: Byte `b == FXMSS_HEIGHT` indicates a stateless signature, any other byte `b < FXMSS_HEIGHT`
indicates a stateful signature using a WOTS+C leaf at height `b` (i.e. depth `FXMSS_HEIGHT - b`).

The verifier recomputes `sl_root` on the stateless path and `sf_root` on the stateful path,
and compares the result against the public key.

This implementation validates the length of the entire signature against the indicator byte, but one
could also stream the signature byte-by-byte during verification, allowing for signature validation
in memory-constrained environments.

- Inputs:
  - `message`: a message of at most `2**61 - 384` bytes.
  - `signature`: a candidate signature, of any length. The stateless path accepts exactly
    `SHRINCS_SL_SIGNATURE_SIZE` bytes. Stateful signature lengths range from
    `SHRINCS_SF_SIGNATURE_SIZE_MIN` to `SHRINCS_SF_SIGNATURE_SIZE_MAX`, and the indicator byte
    determines the exact accepted length. Every other length is rejected.
  - `ctx`: a context of at most 255 bytes.
  - `shrincs_pubkey`: a 48-byte SHRINCS public key.
- Output:
  - a boolean indicating if the signature is valid.

This function is used only by the verifier.

## On Signing Fallibility

The declared return type of some signer functions like `fxmss_sign` is `Optional`, indicating the function may return `None` if the function fails.
This originates from an edge case condition in `wots_c_grind_to_constant_sum` and bubbles up the stack in the stateful signing path, all the way up to `shrincs_sign`.

While this edge case is technically possible to hit, it has such a low probability due to the parameters we use that it is essentially impossible in our universe.
See [the docs for `wots_c_grind_to_constant_sum`](#wots_c_grind_to_constant_sum) to see why.

Still, as this python code is the official specification of SHRINCS, we must account for even extremely low-probability paths in the control flow of the algorithms.
Real-world implementations may treat `shrincs_sign`, `fxmss_sign`, `wots_c_sign`, and `wots_c_grind_to_constant_sum` as infallible functions, provided all input invariants are satisfied.


## Reference Implementation

We provide a naive, highly inefficient, and non-constant-time pure Python 3 implementation of the SHRINCS algorithms in [`impl/shrincs.py`](./impl/shrincs.py), which is the normative source for the algorithms specified in this document.

Tests are provided in [`impl/test.py`](./impl/test.py).
Comprehensive test vectors covering every algorithm are still TODO; they are required to advance this proposal from Draft to Complete.

> [!WARNING]
> The implementation is for demonstration purposes only and not to be used in production environments.
> It exists to generate test vectors and to serve as an executable specification to write independent implementations against.
> It does not sample or protect secret key material, and it performs no state management at all: `shrincs_sign` takes the state counter as a caller-supplied argument and does nothing to prevent the same counter being used twice.
> See [On Managing State](#on-managing-state) for the rules a real implementation must enforce.


## Optimized Implementation

A fully optimized implementation of SHRINCS is still TODO.

[^bip340-security]: The best known classical attacks against the elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem in secp256k1 require work proportional to the square root of the group order.
    Since that order is approximately 2<sup>256</sup>, these attacks require approximately 2<sup>128</sup> group operations.
[^why128]: Although Bitcoin relies on full 32-byte SHA256 outputs elsewhere, this specification uses 16-byte hash outputs.
    By the birthday paradox, a generic search can find two inputs with the same 16-byte hash output after approximately 2<sup>64</sup> evaluations.
    This does not conflict with the category 1 target because SHRINCS does not rely on preventing such collisions to resist signature forgery.
[^xmss-directional]: Can we still prove XMSS secure if we use an unstructured (directionless) tree, a la taproot? (better privacy and XMSS clients are more flexible) No. Unstructured XMSS trees would give an attacker an advantage in multi-target attacks. Say you have an XMSS tree with height two (i.e. four leaves). Let's say you reveal the two intermediate nodes in the first layer to an attacker, e.g. by signing a transaction. The hash function used to compute both of these nodes must be the same - otherwise it would not be a directionless tree - So the attacker can try preimage search on both hash function outputs at once. This doubles their chances of successfully finding a preimage. Scaled up, with more target hashes, the attacker increases their advantage even more.
[^fxmss_node_index]: The key requirement for a valid FXMSS tree shape is that the indexes of all nodes must fit in a 64-bit unsigned integer. This means that while FXMSS trees can be up to 255 layers deep, only the leftmost 2<sup>64</sup> nodes in each layer are indexable. This provides plenty of space while maintaining a fixed max-length encoding for node indexes.
[^last_two_sigs]: The last two UXMSS leaves are both at equal depth, and so their signatures both have the same length.
